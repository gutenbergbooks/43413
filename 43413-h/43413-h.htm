      CHAPTER XXXIV. MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.

      NEXT to pianoforte music for amateur musical entertainments, the quartet
      for stringed instruments was the favourite form of chamber music. The
      performers were occasionally highly cultivated amateurs, but more often
      professional musicians, thus giving scope for more pretentious
      compositions. The comparatively small expense involved enabled others
      besides noblemen, even those of the citizen class who were so inclined, to
      include quartet-playing among their regular entertainments.<a
      href="#linknote34-1" name="linknoteref34-1" id="linknoteref34-1"> 1 </a>
      Jos. Haydn was, as is well known, the musician who gave to the quartet its
      characteristic form and development.<a href="#linknote34-2"
      name="linknoteref34-2" id="linknoteref34-2"> 2 </a> Other composers had
      written works for four stringed instruments, but the string quartet in its
      well-defined and henceforth stationary constitution was his creation, the
      result of his life-work. It is seldom that an artist has been so
      successful in discovering the fittest outcome for his individual
      productiveness; the quartet was Haydn's natural expression of his musical
      nature. The freshness and life, the cheerful joviality, which are the main
      characteristics of his compositions, gained ready and universal acceptance
      for them. Connoisseurs and critics, it is true, were at first suspicious,
      and even contemptuous, of this new kind of music; and it was only
      gradually that they became aware that depth and earnestness of feeling, as
      well as knowledge and skill, existed together with humour in Haydn's
      quartets. He went on his way, however, untroubled <span class="side">MOZART'S
      INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p002.png">[2]</a></span> by the critics, and secured the
      favour and adherence of the public by an unbroken series of works: whoever
      ventured on the same field was obliged to serve under his banner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widespread popularity of quartet music in Vienna could not fail to
      impel Mozart to try his forces in this direction. His master was also his
      attached friend and fellow-artist, with whom he stood in the position, not
      of a scholar, but of an independent artist in noble emulation. The first
      six quartets belong to the comparatively less numerous works which Mozart
      wrote for his own pleasure, without any special external impulse. They
      are, as he says in the dedication to Haydn, the fruit of long and earnest
      application, and extended over a space of several years. The first, in G
      major (387 K.), was, according to a note on the autograph manuscript,
      written on December 31, 1782; the second, in D minor (421 K.), in June,
      1783, during Constanze's confinement (Vol. II., p. 423); and the third, in
      E flat major (428 K.), belongs to the same year. After a somewhat lengthy
      pause he returned with new zeal to the composition of the quartets; the
      fourth, in B flat major (458 K.), was written November 9, 1784; the fifth,
      in A major (464 K.), on January 10; and the last, in C major (465 K.), on
      January 14, 1785. It was in February of this year that Leopold Mozart paid
      his visit to Vienna. He knew the first three quartets, Wolfgang having
      sent them to him according to custom; and he heard the others at a musical
      party where Haydn was also present; the warmly expressed approbation of
      the latter may have been the immediate cause of Mozart's graceful
      dedication, when he published the quartets during the autumn of 1785 (Op.
      ü).<a href="#linknote34-3" name="linknoteref34-3" id="linknoteref34-3"> 3
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular judgment is usually founded on comparison, and a comparison
      with Haydn's quartets was even more obvious than usual on this occasion.
      The Emperor Joseph, who objected to Haydn's "tricks and nonsense" (Vol.
      II., <span class="side">MOZART AND KLOPSTOCK.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p003.png">[3]</a></span> p. 204), requested Dittersdorf in
      1786 to draw a parallel between Haydn's and Mozart's chamber music.
      Dittersdorf answered by requesting the Emperor in his turn to draw a
      parallel between Klopstock and Gellert; whereupon Joseph replied that both
      were great poets, but that Klopstock must be read repeatedly in order to
      understand his beauties, whereas Gellert's beauties lay plainly exposed to
      the first glance. Dittersdorf's analogy of Mozart with Klopstock, Haydn
      with Gellert (!), was readily accepted by the Emperor, who further
      compared Mozart's compositions to a snuffbox of Parisian manufacture,
      Haydn's to one manufactured in London.<a href="#linknote34-4"
      name="linknoteref34-4" id="linknoteref34-4"> 4 </a> The Emperor looked at
      nothing deeper than the respective degrees of taste displayed by the two
      musicians, and could find no better comparison for works of art than
      articles of passing fancy; whereas the composer had regard to the inner
      essence of the works, and placed them on the same footing as those of the
      (in his opinion) greatest poets of Germany. However odd may appear to us&mdash;admiring
      as we do, above all things in Mozart, his clearness and purity of form&mdash;Dittersdorf
      s comparison of him with Klopstock, it is nevertheless instructive, as
      showing that his contemporaries prized his grandeur and dignity, and the
      force and boldness of his expression, as his highest and most
      distinguishing qualities. L. Mozart used also to say, that his son was in
      music what Klopstock was in poetry;<a href="#linknote34-5"
      name="linknoteref34-5" id="linknoteref34-5"> 5 </a> no doubt because
      Klopstock was to him the type of all that was deep and grand. But the
      public did not regard the new phenomenon in the same light; the quality
      they esteemed most highly in Haydn's quartets was their animated
      cheerfulness; and his successors, Dittersdorf, Pichl, Pleyel, had
      accustomed them even to lighter enjoyments. "It is a pity," says a
      favourable critic, in a letter from Vienna (January, 1787), "that in his
      truly artistic and beautiful compositions Mozart should carry his effort
      after originality too far, to the detriment of the sentiment and heart of
      his works. His new quartets, dedicated to Haydn, are much too highly
      spiced to be palatable for any length

      were sent back to the publisher, as being full of printer's errors, and
      even Sarti undertook to prove, in a violent criticism, that some of the
      music in these quartets was insupportable from its wilful offences against
      rule and euphony. The chief stumbling-block is the well-known introduction
      of the C major quartet&mdash;[See Page Image]

      remark. Ulibicheff<a href="#linknote34-11" name="linknoteref34-11"
      id="linknoteref34-11"> 11 </a> undertook to correct the passage with the
      aid of Fétis,<a href="#linknote34-12" name="linknoteref34-12"
      id="linknoteref34-12"> 12 </a> and then considered it both fine and
      pleasing; and Lenz<a href="#linknote34-13" name="linknoteref34-13"
      id="linknoteref34-13"> 13 </a> declared that Mozart in "this delightful
      expression of the doctrine of necessary evil, founded on the insufficiency
      of all finite things" had produced a piquant, but not an incorrect
      passage. It is certain, at least, that Mozart intended to write the
      passage as it stands, and his meaning in so doing, let the grammatical
      construction be what it will, will not be obscure to sympathetic hearers.
      The C major quartet, the last of this first set, is the only one with an
      introduction. The frame of mind expressed in it is a noble, manly
      cheerfulness, rising in the andante to an almost supernatural serenity&mdash;the
      kind of cheerfulness which, in life or in art, appears only as the result
      of previous pain and strife. The sharp accents of the first and second
      movements, the struggling agony of the trio to the minuet, the wonderful
      depth of beauty in the subject of the finale, startling us by its entry,
      first in E flat and then in A flat major, are perhaps the most striking
      illustrations of this, but the introduction stands forth as the element
      which gives birth to all the happy serenity of the work. The contrast
      between the troubled, depressed phrase&mdash;[See Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      has a direct effect upon the hearer; both phrases have one solution:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      and the shrill agitated one&mdash;[See Page Images]

      The manner in which they are opposed to each other, and the devices by
      which their opposition is thrown into strong relief, are of unusual, but
      by no means unjustifiable, harshness. But the goal is not reached by one
      bound; no sooner does serenity seem to be attained than the recurrence of
      the <i>b</i> draws the clouds together again, and peace and the power of
      breathing and moving freely are only won by slow and painful degrees.<a

      Any difference of opinion as to this work at the present day can only
      exist with regard to minor details, and it will scarcely now be asserted
      by any one that "a piece may be recognised as Mozart's by its rapid
      succession of daring transitions."<a href="#linknote34-15"
      name="linknoteref34-15" id="linknoteref34-15"> 15 </a> We are accustomed
      to take our standard from Beethoven, and it seems to us almost incredible
      that a contemporary of Mozart's, the Stuttgart Hofmusicus, Schaul (who
      acknowledged, it is true, that he belonged to a time when nothing was
      heard but Italian operas and musicians), should exclaim:<a
      href="#linknote34-16" name="linknoteref34-16" id="linknoteref34-16"> 16
      </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      What a gulf between a Mozart and a Boccherini! The former leads us over
      rugged rocks on to a waste, sparsely strewn with flowers; the latter
      through smiling country, flowery meadows, and by the side of rippling
      streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from all differences of opinion or analogies with other works, it
      may safely be asserted that these quartets are the clear and perfect
      expression of Mozart's nature; nothing less is to be expected from a work
      upon which he put forth all his powers in order to accomplish something
      that would redound to his master Haydn's honour as well as his own. The
      form had already, in all its essential points, been determined by Haydn;
      it is the sonata form, already described, with the addition of the minuet&mdash;in
      this application a creation of Haydn's. Mozart appropriated these main
      <span class="side">MOZART'S AND HAYDN'S QUARTETS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p007.png">[7]</a></span> features,
      without feeling it incumbent on him even to alter them. Following a deeply
      rooted impulse of his nature, he renounced the light and fanciful style in
      which Haydn had treated them, seized upon their legitimate points, and
      gave a firmer and more delicate construction to the whole fabric. To say
      of Mozart's quartets in their general features that, in comparison with
      Haydn's, they are of deeper and fuller expression, more refined beauty,
      and broader conception of form,<a href="#linknote34-17"
      name="linknoteref34-17" id="linknoteref34-17"> 17 </a> is only to
      distinguish these as Mozart's individual characteristics, in contrast with
      Haydn's inexhaustible fund of original and humorous productive power. Any
      summary comparison of the two masters must result in undue depreciation of
      one or the other, for nothing but a detailed examination would do full
      justice to them both and explain their admiration of each other. Two
      circumstances must not be left out of account. Mozart's quartets are few
      in number compared with the long list of Haydn's. Every point that is of
      interest in Mozart may be paralleled in Haydn; hence it follows that
      certain peculiarities found in Haydn's music are predominating elements in
      Mozart's. Again, Haydn was a much older man, and is therefore usually
      regarded as Mozart's predecessor; but the compositions on which his fame
      chiefly rests belong for the most part to the period of Mozart's activity
      in Vienna, and were not without important influence on the latter. This
      mutual reaction, so generously acknowledged by both musicians, must be
      taken into account in forming a judgment upon them.

      The string quartet offers the most favourable conditions for the
      development of instrumental music, both as to expression and technical
      construction, giving free play to the composer in every direction,
      provided only that he keep within the limits imposed by the nature of his
      art. Each of the four combined instruments is capable of the greatest
      variety of melodic construction; they have the advantage over the piano in
      their power of sustaining the vibrations of the notes, so as to produce
      song-like effects; nor are they inferior <span class="side">MOZART'S
      INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p008.png">[8]</a></span> in their power of rapid movement.
      Their union enables them to fulfil the demands of complete harmonies, and
      to compensate by increase of freedom and fulness for the advantages which
      the pianoforte possesses as a solo instrument. The quartet is therefore
      particularly well adapted both for the polyphonic and the homophonie style
      of composition. The varieties of tone of the instruments among each other,
      and of each in different keys, further increases their capacity for
      expression, the nuances of tone-colouring appearing to belong to the
      nature of stringed instruments. Thus the material sound elements of the
      string quartet are singularly uniform, at the same time that they allow
      free scope to the individual movement of the component parts. The
      beginning of the andante of the E flat major quartet (428 K.) will suffice
      to show how entirely different an effect is given by a mere difference in
      the position of the parts. The value which Mozart set upon the uniformity
      of the naturally beautiful sound effects of stringed instruments may be
      inferred from the fact that he seldom attempted interference with it as a
      device for pleasing the ear. Pizzicato passages occur only three times&mdash;in
      the trio of the D minor quartet (421 K.), of the C major quintet (515 K.),
      and of the clarinet quintet (581 K.)&mdash;and each time as the gentlest
      form of accompaniment to a tender melody. He was not prone either to
      emphasise bass passages by pizzicato, and has done so only in the second
      adagio of the G minor quintet (516 K.) and in the first movement of the
      horn quintet (407 K.). Nor is the muting, formerly so frequent, made use
      of except in the first adagio of the G minor quartet and in the larghetto
      of the clarinet quintet. It need scarcely be said that an equal amount of
      technical execution and musical proficiency was presupposed in each of the
      performers. This is especially noticeable in the treatment of the
      violoncello. It is not only put on a level with the other instruments as
      to execution, but its many-sided character receives due recognition, and
      it is raised from the limited sphere of a bass part into one of complete
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The favourite comparison of the quartet with a conversation between four
      intellectual persons holds good in some <span class="side">MOZART'S STRING
      QUARTETS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p009.png">[9]</a></span>
      degree, if it is kept in mind that the intellectual participation and
      sympathy of the interlocutors, although not necessarily languishing in
      conversation, are only audibly expressed by turns, whereas the musical
      embodiment of ideas must be continuous and simultaneous. The comparison is
      intended to illustrate the essential point that every component part of
      the quartet stands out independently, according to its character, but so
      diffidently that all co-operate to produce a whole which is never at any
      moment out of view; an effect so massive as to absorb altogether the
      individual parts would be as much out of place as the undue emphasising of
      any one part and the subordination of the others to it. The object to be
      kept continually in view is the blending of the homophonie or melodious,
      and the polyphonic or formal elements of composition to form a new and
      living creation. Neither is neglected; but neither is allowed to assert
      itself too prominently. Even when a melody is delivered by one instrument
      alone, the others do not readily confine themselves to a merely harmonic
      accompaniment, but preserve their independence of movement. Infallible
      signs of a master-hand are visible in the free and ingenious adaptation of
      the bass and the middle parts to the melodies; and, as a rule, the
      characteristic disposition of the parts gives occasion for a host of
      interesting harmonic details. The severer forms of counterpoint only
      appear in exceptional cases, such as the last movement of the first
      quartet, in G major (387 K.). The intention is not to work out a subject
      in a given form, but to play freely with it, presenting it from various
      interesting points of view by means of combinations, analysis,
      construction, and connection with fresh contrasting elements. But since
      this free play can only be accepted as artistic by virtue of the internal
      coherency of its component parts, it follows that the same laws which
      govern strict forms must lie at the root of the freer construction. In the
      same way a conversation&mdash;even though severe logical disputation may
      be studiously avoided&mdash;adheres to the laws of logic while letting
      fall here a main proposition, there a subordinate idea, and connecting
      apparent incongruities by means of association of ideas. A similar freedom
      in the grouping and <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p010.png">[10]</a></span>
      development of the different subjects exists in the quartet, limited only
      by the unity of artistic conception, and by the main principles of
      rhythmic and harmonic structure, and of the forms of counterpoint. This is
      most observable when an apparently unimportant phrase is taken up, and by
      its interesting development formed into an essential element of the whole,
      as in the first movement of the third quartet, in B flat major (458 K.),
      where a figure&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      at the close of a lengthy subject is first repeated by the instruments
      separately, with a mocking sort of air, and afterwards retained and
      treated as the germ of numerous freely developed images.
    </p>
    <p>
      In publishing these six quartets together Mozart certainly did not intend
      them to be regarded in all their parts as one whole; his object was to
      bring to view the many-sidedness of expression and technical treatment of
      which this species of music was capable. The first quartet, in G major
      (387 K.), and the fourth, in E flat major (428 K.), have a certain
      relationship in their earnest and sustained tone; but how different is the
      expression of energetic decision in the first from that of contemplative
      reserve in the fourth; a difference most noticeable in the andantes of the
      two quartets. Again, in the third and fifth quartets, in B flat (458 K.)
      and A major (464 K.), the likeness in their general character is
      individualised by the difference in treatment throughout. The second
      quartet, in D minor (421 K.), and the sixth, in C major (465 K.), stand
      alone; the former by its affecting expression of melancholy, the latter by
      its revelation of that higher peace to which a noble mind attains through
      strife and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      An equal wealth of characterisation and technical elaboration meets us in
      a comparison of the separate movements. The ground-plan of the first
      movement is the usual one, and the centre of gravity is always the
      working-out at the beginning of the second part, which is therefore
      distinguished by its length as a principal portion of the movement. The
      working-out of each quartet is peculiar to itself. In the two <span
      class="side">SIX QUARTETS, 1785.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p011.png">[11]</a></span> first the principal subject is
      made the groundwork, and combined with the subordinate subject closing the
      first part, but quite differently worked-out. In the G major quartet the
      first subject is spun out into a florid figure, which is turned hither and
      thither, broken off by the entry of the second subject, again resumed,
      only to be again broken off in order, by an easy play on the closing bar&mdash;[See
      Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      to lead back again to the theme. In the D minor quartet, on the other
      hand, only the first characteristic division&mdash;[See Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      of the broad theme is worked out as a motif; the next division somewhat
      modified&mdash;[See Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      is imitated and adorned by the final figure:&mdash;[See Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part of the third quartet, in B flat major, has not the usual
      sharply accented second subject; the second part makes up for this in a
      measure by at once introducing a new and perfectly formed melody, followed
      by an easy play with a connecting passage&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      this is invaded by the analogous motif of the first part&mdash;[See Page
      Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      which brings about the return to the first part. The peculiar structure of
      the movement occasions the repetition of the second part, whereupon a
      third part introduces the chief subject anew, and leads to the conclusion
      in an independent <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p012.png">[12]</a></span> way. In
      the E flat major quartet the interest depends upon the harmonic treatment
      of an expressive triplet passage connected with the principal subject. The
      first subject of the fifth quartet, in A major, is indicated from the very
      beginning as a suitable one for imitative treatment, and very freely
      developed in the working-out section. In the last quartet in C major also,
      the treatment of the principal subject is indicated at once, but the
      importance of the modest theme is only made apparent by the harmonic and
      contrapuntal art of its working-out, leading to the expressive climax of
      the coda and the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slow movements of the quartets are the mature fruit of deep feeling
      and masterly skill. With fine discrimination the consolatory andante of
      the melancholy D minor quartet is made easy, but so managed as to express
      the character of ardent longing, both in the ascending passage&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      and in the tendency to fall into the minor key. The andante of the fourth
      quartet, in E flat major, forms a complete contrast to this. Its incessant
      harmonic movement only allows of pregnant suggestions of melodies, and is
      expressive of a self-concentrated mood, rousing itself with difficulty
      from mental abstraction. But the crown of them all in delicacy of form and
      depth of expression is the andante of the last quartet, in C major; it
      belongs to those wonderful manifestations of genius which are only of the
      earth in so far as they take effect upon human minds; which soar aloft
      into a region of blessedness where suffering and passion are transfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minuets are characteristic of Mozart's tendencies as opposed to
      Haydn's. The inexhaustible humour, the delight in startling and whimsical
      fancy, which form the essence of Haydn's minuets, occur only here and
      there in Mozart's. <span class="side">SIX QUARTETS, 1785.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p013.png">[13]</a></span> They are cast
      in a nobler mould, their distinguishing characteristics being grace and
      delicacy, and they are equally capable of expressing merry drollery and
      strong, even painful, emotion. Haydn's minuets are the product of a
      laughter-loving national life, Mozart's give the tone of good society.
      Especially well-defined in character are the minuets of the D minor and C
      major quartets&mdash;the former bold and defiant, the latter fresh and
      vigorous. Delicate detail in the disposition of the parts is common to
      almost all of them, keeping the interest tense and high, and there are
      some striking peculiarities of rhythmical construction. Among such we may
      notice the juxtaposition of groups of eight and ten bars, so that two bars
      are either played prematurely, as in the minuet of the first quartet, or
      inserted, as in the trio of the B flat major quartet.<a
      href="#linknote34-18" name="linknoteref34-18" id="linknoteref34-18"> 18
      </a> The ten-bar group in the minuet of the D minor quartet is more
      complicated, because more intimately blended, and still more so is the
      rhythm of the minuet in the fourth quartet, where the detached unequal
      groups are curiously interlaced.<a href="#linknote34-19"
      name="linknoteref34-19" id="linknoteref34-19"> 19 </a> Very characteristic
      is also the sharp contrast between minuet and trio&mdash;as, for instance,
      the almost harshly passionate minor trios of the first and last quartets,
      and the still more striking major trio of the D minor quartet, light and
      glittering, like a smile in the midst of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finales have more meaning and emphasis than has hitherto been the case
      in Mozart's instrumental compositions. Three of them are in rondo form
      (those of the B flat, E flat, and C major quartet), quick, easy-flowing
      movements, rich in graceful motifs and interesting features in the
      working-out. The merriment in them is tempered by 1 a deeper vein of
      humour, and we are sometimes startled by a display of pathos, as in the
      finale of the C major quartet. The more cheerful passages are distinctly
      German in tone; and echoes of the "Zauberflote" may be heard in many of
      the melodies and turns of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p014.png">[14]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The last movement of the G major quartet is written in strict form, and
      highly interesting by reason of the elegance of its counterpoint; the
      finale of the A major quartet is freer and easier, but nevertheless
      polyphonic in treatment.<a href="#linknote34-20" name="linknoteref34-20"
      id="linknoteref34-20"> 20 </a> The D minor quartet concludes with
      variations, the original and long-drawn theme having the rhythmical and
      sharply accented harmonic form of the siciliana. It is in imitation of a
      national song, and is sometimes like a slow gigue, sometimes like a
      pastorale. The rhythm of the 6-8 time is somewhat peculiar, in that the
      first of three quavers is dotted throughout; the tone is soft and tender.
      There is a very similar siciliana in Gluck's ballet "Don Juan" (No. 2),
      showing how marked the typical character is.<a href="#linknote34-21"
      name="linknoteref34-21" id="linknoteref34-21"> 21 </a> The variations,
      which are as charming from their grace and delicacy of form as from their
      singular mixture of melancholy and mirth, bring this wonderful quartet to
      a close in a very original manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle movement of the A major quartet is also in variations&mdash;more
      earnest and careful on the whole&mdash;the precursor of the variations in
      Haydn's "Kaiser" and Beethoven's A major quartets. These quartet
      variations far surpass the pianoforte variations in character and
      workmanship; they consist not merely of a graceful play of passages, but
      of a characteristic development of new motifs springing from the theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the quartets, on which Mozart put forth all his best
      powers, was scarcely sufficient to encourage him to make further attempts
      in the same direction; not until August, 1786, do we find him again
      occupied with a quartet (D major, 499 K.), in which may be traced an
      attempt to <span class="side">LATER QUARTETS, 1786-1790.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p015.png">[15]</a></span> meet the taste
      of the public without sacrificing the dignity of the quartet style. It is
      not inferior to the others in any essential point. The technical work is
      careful and interesting, the design broad&mdash;in many respects freer
      than formerly&mdash;the tone cheerful and forcible throughout, with the
      sentimental element in the background, as compared with the first
      quartets. The last movement approaches nearest to Haydn's humorous turn of
      thought, following his manner also in the contrapuntal elaboration of a
      lightly suggested motif into a running stream of merry humour.
      Nevertheless, this quartet remained without any immediate successor; it
      would appear that it met with no very general approval on its first
      appearance. "A short serenade, consisting of an allegro, romance, minuet
      and trio, and finale" in G major, composed August 10, 1787 (525 K.), does
      not belong to quartet music proper. The direction for violoncello,
      contrabasso, points to a fuller setting, which is confirmed by the whole
      arrangement, especially in the treatment of the middle parts. It is an
      easy, precisely worked-out occasional piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his stay in Berlin and Potsdam in the spring of 1789 Mozart was
      repeatedly summoned to the private concerts of Frederick William II. of
      Prussia, in which the monarch himself took part as a violoncellist. He was
      a clever and enthusiastic pupil of Graziani and Duport, and he
      commissioned Mozart to write quartets for him, as he had previously
      commissioned Haydn<a href="#linknote34-22" name="linknoteref34-22"
      id="linknoteref34-22"> 22 </a> and Boccherini,<a href="#linknote34-23"
      name="linknoteref34-23" id="linknoteref34-23"> 23 </a> rewarding them with
      princely liberality. In June of this year Mozart completed the first of
      three quartets, composed for and dedicated to the King of Prussia, in D
      major (575 K.); the second, in B flat major (589 K.), and the third, in F
      major (590 K.), were composed in May and June, 1790. From letters to
      Puchberg, we know <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p016.png">[16]</a></span> that
      this was a time of bitter care and poverty, which made it a painful effort
      to work at the quartets, but there is even less trace of effort in them
      than in the earlier ones. The instrument appropriated to his royal patron
      is brought to the front, and made into a solo instrument, giving out the
      melodies in its higher notes. This obliges the viola frequently to take
      the bass part, altering the whole tone-colouring of the piece, and the
      instruments are altogether set higher than usual, the more so as the first
      violin constantly alternates with the violoncello. By this means the tone
      of the whole becomes more brilliant and brighter, but atones for this in
      an occasional loss of vigour and force. In other respects also, out of
      deference no doubt to the King's taste, there is more stress laid upon
      elegance and clearness than upon depth and warmth of tone. Mozart was too
      much of an artist to allow any solo part in a quartet to predominate
      unduly over the others; the first violin and violoncello leave the other
      two instruments their independent power of expression, but the motifs and
      working-out portions are less important, and here and there they run into
      a fanciful play of passages. It is singular that in the quartets in D and
      F major the last movements are the most important. When once the composer
      has thrown himself into the elaboration of his trifling motifs he grows
      warm, and, setting to work in good earnest, the solo instrument is made to
      fall into rank and file; the artist appears, and has no more thought of
      his presentation at court. The middle movements are very fine as to form
      and effect, but are without any great depth of feeling. The charming
      allegro of the second quartet, in F major, is easy and graceful in tone,
      and interesting from the elegance of its elaboration. In short, these
      quartets completely maintain Mozart's reputation for inventive powers,
      sense of proportion, and mastery of form, but they lack that absolute
      devotion to the highest ideal of art characteristic of the earlier ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's partiality for quartet-writing may be inferred from the many
      sketches which remain (68-75, Anh., K.), some of them of considerable
      length, such as that fragment of a lively movement in A major (68, 72,
      Anh., K.) consisting of 169 bars.

      <span class="side">TRIO IN E FLAT, 1788.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p017.png">[17]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Duets and trios for stringed instruments were naturally held in less
      esteem than string quartets. Mozart composed in Vienna (September 27,
      1788), for some unspecified occasion, a trio for violin, viola, and
      violoncello, in £ flat major (563 K.), which consists of six movements,
      after the manner of a divertimento&mdash;allegro, adagio, minuet, andante
      with variations, minuet, rondo. The omission of the one instrument
      increases the difficulty of composing a piece full in sound and
      characteristic in movement, more than could have been imagined; the
      invention and skill of the composer are taxed to the utmost. It is evident
      that this only gave the work an additional charm to Mozart. Each of the
      six movements is broadly designed and carried out with equal care and
      devotion, making this trio unquestionably one of Mozart's finest works. No
      one performer is preferred before the other, but each, if he does his
      duty, may distinguish himself in his own province. With wonderful
      discrimination, too, every technical device is employed which can give an
      impulse to any happy original idea. How beautifully, for instance, is the
      simple violoncello passage which ushers in the adagio&mdash;[See Page
      Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      transformed into the emphatic one for the violin&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      coined in due time, with climacteric effect, by the viola and violoncello.
      The violin-jumps in the same adagio&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      are effective only in their proper position; and all the resources at
      command are made subservient to the art which is to produce the living
      work.

    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p018.png">[18]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The variations demand special attention. The theme is suggestive of a
      national melody, and its effect is heightened by the different treatment
      of each part when repeated, which also gives fulness and variety to the
      variations. Each of these is artistically worked out in detail and of
      distinctly individual character; the last is especially remarkable, in
      which the viola, to a very lively figure, carries out the theme in its
      simplest enunciation as a true Cantus firmus. The whole impression is one
      of freshness and beauty of conception, elevated and enlivened by the
      difficulties which offered themselves. Nothing more charming can be
      imagined than the first trio of the second minuet; its tender purity
      charms us like that of a flower gleaming through the grass.

      Haydn seems to have made no use of the increased resources offered by the
      quintet, although other musicians&mdash;Boccherini, for instance&mdash;cultivated
      this branch. It would appear to have been for some particular occasions
      that Mozart composed four great string quintets, in which he followed the
      track laid out in the first quartets. Two were composed in the spring of
      1787, after his return from Prague&mdash;<a href="#linknote34-24"

      id="linknoteref34-27"> 27 </a>&mdash;whereby little alteration in tone,
      colour, or structure is effected. The doubling of the violoncello gives it
      a predominance which its very charm of tone <span class="side">THE
      QUINTET.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p019.png">[19]</a></span>
      renders all the more dangerous: whereas the strengthening of the less
      strongly accentuated middle parts by the addition of a viola gives freer
      scope for a lengthy composition. The additional instrument gives increase
      of freedom in the formation of melodies and their harmonic development,
      but it also lays on the composer the obligation of providing independent
      occupation for the enlarged parts. A chief consideration is the grouping
      of the parts in their numerous possible combinations. The first viola
      corresponds to the first violin as leader of melodies, while the second
      viola leaves the violoncello greater freedom of action; these parts share
      the melodies in twos or threes, either alternately or in imitative
      interweaving; the division of a motif as question and answer among
      different instruments is especially facilitated thereby. Again, two
      divisions may be placed in effective contrast, the violins being supported
      by a viola, or the violas by the violoncello. But the device first used by
      Haydn in his quartets, of giving two parts in octaves, is perhaps the most
      effective in the quintets, a threefold augmentation being even employed in
      the trio of the E flat major quintet (614 K.). Finally, it is easier to
      strengthen the violoncello by the viola here than it is in the quartet. It
      is not that all these resources are out of reach for the quartet, but that
      they find freer and fuller scope in the quintet. The effect of the quintet
      is not massive; it rests on the characteristic movement of the individual
      parts, and demands greater freedom in order that this movement of manifold
      and differing forces may be well ordered and instinct with living power.
      The increased forces require greater space for their activity, if only on
      account of the increased mass of sound. If the middle parts are to move
      freely without pressing on each other, the outer parts must be farther
      apart, and this has a decided influence on the melodies and the sound
      effects, the general impression becoming more forcible and brilliant. The
      dimensions must also be increased in other directions. A theme, to be
      divided among five parts, and a working-out which is to give each of them
      fair play, must be planned from the first. The original motif of the first
      Allegro of the C major quintet (515 K.)&mdash;[See Page Image] <span
      class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p020.png">[20]</a></span> involves of necessity the
      continuation of the idea enunciated; and only after a third repetition
      with modifications is it allowed to proceed to a conclusion. It has thus
      become too far developed to allow of a repetition of the whole theme; it
      starts again in C minor, is further developed by harmonic inflections; and
      after a short by-play on a tributary, it is again taken up and leads on to
      the second theme; we have thus a complete organic development of the first
      motif. The second theme is then of course carried out, and finally we have
      the broadly designed motif which brings the part to a conclusion in a
      gradually increasing <i>crescendo</i> for all the parts; the whole
      movement thus gains considerably in dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motif of the first movement of the E flat major quintet (614 K.)&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      is precisely rendered. But it is the germ whence the whole movement is to
      spring; all beyond itself is suggested by this motif, and is important
      only in relation thereto. The unfettered cheerfulness which runs through
      the whole of the movement is expressed in these few bars, given by the
      violas like a call to the merry chase. The opening of the C major quintet
      prepares us in an equally decided manner for what is to follow. The
      decision and thoughtfulness which form the ground-tone of the whole
      movement, in spite of its lively agitation, are calmly and clearly
      expressed in the first few bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The G minor quintet begins very differently, with a complete melody of
      eight bars, repeated in a different key. Few <span class="side">MOZART'S G
      MINOR QUINTET.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p021.png">[21]</a></span>
      instrumental compositions express a mood of passionate excitement with
      such energy as this G minor quintet. We feel our pity stirred in the first
      movement by a pain which moans, sighs, weeps; is conscious in its ravings
      only of itself, refuses to take note of anything but itself, and finds its
      only consolation in unreasoning outbreaks of emotion, until it ends
      exhausted by the struggle. But the struggle begins anew in the minuet, and
      now there is mingled with it a feeling of defiant resentment, showing that
      there is some healthy force still remaining; in the second part a memory
      of happy times involuntarily breaks in, but is overcome by the present
      pain; then the trio bursts forth irresistibly, as if by a higher power,
      proclaiming the blessed certainty that happiness is still to be attained.
      One of those apparently obvious touches, requiring nevertheless the
      piercing glance of true genius, occurs when, after closing the minuet in
      the most sorrowful minor accents&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart introduces the trio with the same inflection in the major&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      and proceeds to carry it out in such a manner that only a whispered
      longing may be detected underlying the gently dying sounds of peace. This
      turn of expression decides the further course of the development. The next
      movement, "Adagio ma non troppo, con sordini," gives us an insight into a
      mind deeply wounded, tormented with self-questionings; earnest reflection,
      doubt, resolve, outbreaks of smothered pain alternate with each other,
      until a yearning <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p022.png">[22]</a></span> cry for
      comfort arises, tempered by the confident hope of an answer to its appeal;
      and so the movement ends in the calm of a joyful peace instead of, as the
      first, in the silence of exhaustion. The conquered pain breaks out again
      in the introduction to the last movement, but its sting is broken&mdash;it
      dies away to make room for another feeling. The new émotion is not merely
      resignation, but joy&mdash;the passionate consciousness of bliss, just as
      inspired, just as restlessly excited as the previous pain. But the
      exultant dithyramb has not the same engrossing interest for the hearers;
      man is readier to sympathise with the sorrows of others than with their
      joys, although he would rather bear his sorrow alone than his joy. This
      complete change of mood may well excite a suspicion of fickleness, but it
      is not the less true that the anguish of the first movement, and the
      exultation of the last, belong to one and the same nature, and are
      rendered with absolute truth of artistic expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      We turn involuntarily from the artist to the man after such a
      psychological revelation as this, and find traces of Mozart's nature
      unmistakably impressed on his work. But we may seek in vain for any
      suggestion of the work in his actual daily life. At the time when he wrote
      this quintet his circumstances were favourable, he had only lately
      returned from Prague covered with honour and substantial rewards, and he
      was enjoying an intercourse with the Jacquin family which must have been
      altogether pleasurable to him. It is true that he lost his father soon
      after (May 26), but a recollection of the letter which he addressed to him
      with the possibility of his death in view (Vol. II., p. 323), Mozart being
      at the time engaged on the C major quintet, will prevent our imagining
      that the mood of the G minor quintet was clouded by the thought of his
      father's approaching decease. The springs of artistic production flow too
      deep to be awakened by any of the accidents of life. The artist, indeed,
      can only give what is in him and what he, has himself experienced; but
      Goethe's saying holds good of the musician as well as of the poet or
      painter; he reveals nothing that he has not felt, but nothing <i>as</i> he
      felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main characteristics of the other quintets are calmer <span
      class="side">MOZART'S QUINTETS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p023.png">[23]</a></span> and more cheerful, but they are
      not altogether wanting in energetic expression of passion. The sharper
      characterisation made necessary by the division of the music among a
      greater number of instruments was only possible by means of the agitation
      and restless movement of the parts, even when the tone of the whole was
      quiet and contained. We find therefore various sharp or even harsh details
      giving zest to the whole&mdash;such, for instance, as the use of the minor
      ninth and the comparatively frequent successions of ninths in a circle of
      fifths; and the quintets have apparently been a mine of wealth to later
      composers, who have made exaggerated use of these dangerous stimulants.
      Greater freedom of motion stands in close connection with the better
      defined characterisation of the quintets. Polyphony is their vital
      element; the forms of counterpoint became more appropriate as the number
      of parts increased. The finales to the Quintets in D and E flat Major
      (573, 614, K.) showed that Mozart was able to make use of the very
      strictest forms upon occasion. Both movements begin in innocent
      light-heartedness, but severe musical combinations are developed out of
      the airy play of fancy; ideas which have only been, as it were, suggested
      are taken up and worked out, severe forms alternate with laxer ones&mdash;one
      leads to the other naturally and fluently, and sometimes they are both
      made use of at the same time. The disposition of the parts is free,
      without any preconceived or definitive form, and its many delicate details
      of taste and originality give an individual charm to each separate part.
      The homophonie style of composition is not altogether disregarded for the
      polyphonic, but it is never made the determining element. Even a melody
      such as the second subject of the first movement of the G minor quintet,
      complete in itself as any melody can be, is made use of as a motif for
      polyphonic development. The freest and most elastic treatment of form is
      that of the last movements. The other movements are fully developed, and
      sometimes carried out at great length, but the main features are always
      distinct and well preserved; the outline of the finales is less firm, and
      capable of a lighter and more varied treatment.

      Another branch of concerted music high in favour in Mozart's day was the
      so-called "Harmoniemusik," written exclusively for wind instruments, and
      for performance at table or as serenades. Families of rank frequently
      retained the services of a band for "Harmoniemusik" instead of a complete
      orchestra.<a href="#linknote34-28" name="linknoteref34-28"

      Besides the great serenades, intended for public performance, the old
      custom was still practised of writing "Standchen,"<a href="#linknote34-33"
      name="linknoteref34-33" id="linknoteref34-33"> 33 </a> for performance
      under the window of the person who was to be thus celebrated; and the

      sometimes by two oboes. Such eight-part harmonies sufficed both the
      Emperor and the Elector of Cologne as table-music and for serenades; and
      at a court festival at Berlin in 1791 the music during the banquet was
      thus appointed.<a href="#linknote34-35" name="linknoteref34-35"

    <p>
      Mozart did not neglect the opportunities thus afforded him of making
      himself known during his residence in Vienna. He writes to his father
      (November 3, 1781):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I must apologise for not writing by the last post; it fell just on my
      birthday (October 31), and the early part of the day was given to my
      devotions. Afterwards, when I should have written, a shower of
      congratulations came and prevented me. At twelve o'clock I drove to the
      Leopoldstadt, to the Baroness Waldstädten, where I spent the day. At
      eleven o'clock at night I was greeted by a serenade for two clarinets, two
      horns, and two bassoons, of my own composition. I had composed it on St.
      Theresa's day (October 15) for the sister of Frau von Hickl (the
      portrait-painter's wife), and it was then performed for the first time.
      The six gentlemen who execute such pieces are poor fellows, but they play
      very well together, especially the first clarinet and the two horns. The
      chief reason I wrote it was to let Herr von Strack (who goes there daily)
      hear something of mine, and on this account I made it rather serious. It
      was very much admired. It was played in three different places on St.
      Theresa's night. When people had had enough of it in one place they went
      to another, and got paid over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This "rather serious" composition is the Serenade in E flat major (375
      K.), which Mozart increased by the addition of two oboes, no doubt in
      June, 1782, when he also wrote the Serenade in C minor for eight wind
      instruments (388 K., s.). He had at that time more than one occasion for
      works of this kind. The attention both of the Emperor and the Archduke
      Maximilian was directed towards him (Vol. II., p. 197); and since
      Reichardt heard compositions by Mozart at court in 1783, his attempt to
      gain Strack's good offices must have been successful. In the year 1782
      Prince Liechtenstein was in treaty with Mozart concerning the arrangement
      of a Harmoniemusik (Vol. II., p. 206), and he <span class="side">MOZART'S
      INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p026.png">[26]</a></span> had undertaken with Martin the
      conduct of the Augarten concerts, which involved the production of four
      great public serenades (Vol. II., p. 283).
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the serenades already mentioned are striking compositions, far above
      the ordinary level of their kind, and may be considered, both as to style
      and treatment, the precursors of modern chamber music. The first movement
      of the Serenade in E flat major had originally two parts, which Mozart
      afterwards condensed into one, giving it greater precision by the omission
      of lengthy repetitions. The addition of the oboes gives it greater fulness
      and variety; but it is easy to detect that they are additions to a
      finished work. The whole piece is of genuine serenade character. After a
      brilliant introductory phrase, a plaintive melody makes its unexpected
      appearance, dying away in a sort of sigh, but only to reassert itself with
      greater fervour. The amorous tone of the "Entführung" may be distinctly
      traced in the adagio, and through all its mazy intertwining of parts we
      seem to catch the tender dialogue of two lovers. The closing rondo is full
      of fresh, healthy joy; the suggestion of a national air in no way
      interferes with the interesting harmonic and contrapuntal working-out.<a
      href="#linknote34-36" name="linknoteref34-36" id="linknoteref34-36"> 36
      </a> The Serenade in C minor is far from leaving the same impression of
      cheerful homage. The seriousness of its tone is not that of sorrow or
      melancholy, but, especially in the first movement, of strong resolution.
      The second theme is especially indicative of this, its expressive melody
      being further noteworthy by reason of its rhythmical structure. It
      consists of two six-bar phrases, of which the first is formed of two
      sections of three bars each:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      After the repetition of this, the second phrase follows, formed from the
      same melodic elements, but in three sections of two bars each&mdash;[See
      Page Image] <span class="side">SERENADE IN C MINOR.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p027.png">[27]</a></span> and also
      repeated. On its first occurrence it forms a fine contrast to the
      passionate commencement, and lays the foundation for the lively and
      forcible conclusion of the first part, while in the second part its
      transposition into the minor prepares the way for the gloomy and agitated
      conclusion of the movement. The calmer mood of the andante preserves the
      serious character of the whole, without too great softness or languor of
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart has perpetrated a contrapuntal joke in the minuet. The oboes and
      bassoons lead a two-part canon in octave, while the clarinets and horns
      are used as tutti parts. In the four-part trio the oboes and bassoons
      again carry out a two-part canon (<i>al rovescio</i>) in which the
      answering part exactly renders the rhythm and intervals, the latter,
      however, inverted:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      Tricks of this kind should always come as this does, without apparent
      thought or effort, as if they were thrown together by a happy chance, the
      difficulties of form serving only to give a special flavour to the
      euphonious effect. The last movement, variations, passes gradually from a
      disquieted anxious mood into a calmer one, and closes by a recurrence to
      the subject in the major, with freshness and force.

    <p>
      This serenade is best known in the form of a quintet for stringed
      instruments, to which Mozart adapted it apparently before 1784 (506 K.).
      Nothing essential is altered&mdash;only the middle parts, accompaniment
      passages, &amp;c., are somewhat modified. Some of the passages and
      movements, however, especially the andante and finale, have lost
      considerably by the altered tone-colouring.

      Various divertimenti for wind instruments, which have been published under

      </a> The combination of instruments points here as elsewhere (Vol. II.,
      pp. 361, 410) to some special, perhaps masonic occasion, the more so as a
      detached and independent adagio could only have been written with a
      definite object in view. The juxtaposition of instruments so nearly
      related, with their full, soft, and, in their deeper notes, sepulchral
      tones, produces an impression of solemnity, which is in accordance with
      the general facter of peace after conflict expressed by the adagio.

    <p>
      Mozart's works for wind instruments are distinguished by delicacy of
      treatment apart from virtuoso-like effects. Considering them, however, in
      the light of studies for the treatment of wind instruments as essential
      elements of the full orchestra, they afford no mean conception of the
      performances of instrumentalists from whom so much mastery of technical
      difficulties, delicacy of detail, and expressive delivery might be
      expected. Instrumental music had risen to great importance in Vienna at
      that time. A great number of available, and even distinguished musicians
      had settled there. Besides the two admirably appointed imperial
      orchestras, and the private bands attached to families of rank, there were
      various societies of musicians ready to form large or small orchestras
      when required; and public and private concerts were, as we have seen, of
      very frequent occurrence.

      The appointment was, as a rule, weak, when judged by the standard of the
      present day. The opera orchestra contained one of each wind instrument,
      six of each violin, with four violas, three violoncelli, and three basses.<a

      </a> On particular occasions the orchestra was strengthened (Vol. II., p.

      that they were not intended for large orchestras. The purity and equality
      of tone and the animated delivery of the Vienna orchestra is extolled by a
      contemporary, who seems to have been no connoisseur, but to have

      </a> It was not a matter of small importance, therefore, that Mozart
      should have learnt all that could be learnt from the orchestras of
      Mannheim, Munich, and Paris, and then found in Vienna the forces at
      command wherewith to perfect this branch of his art. In this respect he
      had a great advantage over Haydn, who had only the Esterhazy band at his
      disposal, and never heard great instrumental performances except during
      his short stays in Vienna.

    <p>
      Mozart had much to do with raising the Vienna orchestra, particularly in
      the wind instruments, to its highest pitch of perfection. Among
      contemporary composers, who strove to turn to the best account the
      advantages of a fuller instrumentation,
    </p>
    <p>
      Haydn undoubtedly claims the first rank. It is his incontestable merit to
      have opened the way in his symphonies to the free expression of artistic
      individuality in instrumental music, to have defined its forms, and
      developed <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p030.png">[30]</a></span> them with the
      many-sidedness of genius; he did not, how-I ever, bequeath to Mozart, but
      rather received from him the well-appointed, fully organised, and finely
      proportioned orchestra of our day. In his old age Haydn once complained to
      Kalkbrenner that death should call man away before he has accomplished his
      life-long desires: "I have only learnt the proper use of wind instruments
      in my old age, and now I must pass away without turning my knowledge to
      account."<a href="#linknote34-43" name="linknoteref34-43"
      id="linknoteref34-43"> 43 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the seven Vienna symphonies is in D major (part 5, 384 K.
      (likely 385 K. DW)), and was composed by Mozart, at his father's wish, for
      a Salzburg fête in the summer of 1782. He wrote it under the pressure of
      numerous engagements in less than a fortnight, sending the movements as
      they were ready to his father (Vol. II., p. 211). No wonder that when he
      saw it again he was "quite surprised," not "remembering a word of it." For
      performance in Vienna (March 3, 1783) he reduced it to the usual four
      movements by the omission of the march and of one of the minuets, and
      strengthened the wind instruments very effectively in the first and last
      movement by flutes and clarinets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lively, festive style was called for by the occasion, and in the
      treatment of the different movements the influence of the old serenade
      form is still visible. The first allegro has only one main subject, with
      which it begins; this subject enters with a bold leap&mdash;[See Page
      Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      and keeps its place to the end with a life and energy enhanced by harsh
      dissonances of wonderful freshness and vigour. The whole movement is a
      continuous treatment of this subject, no other independent motif occurring
      at all. The first part is therefore not repeated, the working-out section
      is short, and the whole movement differs considerably from the usual form
      of a first symphony movement. The andante is in the simplest lyric form,
      pretty and refined, but nothing more; the minuet is fresh and brilliant
      (Vol. I., p. 219).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">THE D MAJOR SYMPHONY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p031.png">[31]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The tolerably long drawn-out concluding rondo is lively and brilliant, and
      far from insignificant, though not equal to the first movement in force
      and fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second symphony was written by Mozart in great haste on his journey
      through Linz in November, 1783; it was apparently that in C major (part 6,
      425 K.), which with another short symphony in G major (part 6, 444 K.),
      bears clear traces of Haydn's influence, direct and indirect. (Note: By M.
      Haydn&mdash;the Introduction only by Mozart. DW)
    </p>
    <p>
      Several years lie between these symphonies and the next in D major (part
      1, 504 K.). This was written for the winter concerts on December 6, 1786,
      and met with extraordinary approbation, especially in Prague, where Mozart
      performed it in January, 1787<a href="#linknote34-44"
      name="linknoteref34-44" id="linknoteref34-44"> 44 </a>The first glance at
      the symphony shows an altered treatment of the orchestra; it is now fully
      organised, and both in combination and detail shows individual
      independence. The instrumentation is very clear and brilliant&mdash;here
      and there perhaps a little sharp&mdash;but this tone is purposely selected
      as the suitable one. Traces of Haydn's influence may be found in the
      prefixing of a solemn introduction to the first allegro, as well as in
      separate features of the andante; such, for instance, as the epigrammatic
      close; but in all essential points we have nothing but Mozart. The adagio
      is an appropriate preface for the allegro, which expresses in its whole
      character a lively but earnest struggle. In this allegro the form of a
      great symphony movement lies open before us. The chief subject is
      completely expressed at the beginning&mdash;[See Page Image] <span
      class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p032.png">[32]</a></span> and recurs after a half-close on
      the dominant with a characteristic figure&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      thus allowing of the independent development of section B. Then, after a
      complete close on the dominant, there enters the very characteristic and
      originally treated second subject; the close of the part is introduced by
      the figure, D, so that a member of the chief subject, A, is again touched
      upon. The working-out in the second part is founded on the third section
      of the chief subject, C. These two bars, which there formed only an
      intermediate passage, are here treated imitatively as an independent
      motif; first B, then D, are added as counter-subjects, all three are
      worked-out together, tributary subjects reappear from the first part,
      until the chief subject, A, enters on the dominant in D minor, leading the
      way for the other motifs, which press in simultaneously, and glide upon a
      long organ point gradually back to the first subject, with which the
      modified repetition of the first part begins. In this lengthy working-out
      every part of the main idea is fully developed. The simple enunciations of
      the first part appear, after the elaboration of their different elements
      like utterances of a higher power, bringing conviction and satisfaction to
      all who hear. The springlike charm of the andante, with all its tender
      grace, never degenerates into effeminacy; its peculiar character is given
      by the short, interrupted subject&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      which is given in unison or imitation by the treble part and the bass, and
      runs through the whole, different harmonic turns giving it a tone,
      sometimes of mockery, sometimes of thoughtful reserve. The last movement
      (for this symphony has no minuet) displays the greatest agitation and
      vivacity <span class="side">SYMPHONIES, 1788.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p033.png">[33]</a></span> without any license; in this it
      accords with the restraint which characterises the other movements. It
      illustrates the moderation of most of Mozart's great works, which, as
      Ambros ("Granzen der Musik und Poesie," p. 56) remarks, "is not a proof of
      inability to soar into a higher sphere, but a noble and majestic
      proportioning of all his forces, that so they may hold each other in
      equilibrium." The essence of the work, to borrow the aesthetic expression
      of the ancients, is ethic rather than pathetic; character, decision,
      stability find expression there rather than passion or fleeting
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year and a half passed before Mozart again turned his attention to the
      composition of symphonies; then, in the summer of 1788, within two months,
      he composed the three symphonies in E flat major (June 26), G minor (July
      25), and C major (August 10)&mdash;the compositions which most readily
      occur to us when Mozart's orchestral works come under discussion. The
      production of such widely differing and important works within so short a
      space of time affords another proof that the mind of an artist works and
      creates undisturbed by the changing impressions of daily life, and that
      the threads are spun in secret which are to form the weft and woof of a
      work of art. The symphonies display Mozart's perfected power of making the
      orchestra, by means of free movement and songlike delivery, into the organ
      of his artistic mood. As Richard Wagner says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The longing sigh of the great human voice, drawn to him by the loving
      power of his genius, breathes from his instruments. He leads the
      irresistible stream of richest harmony into the heart of his melody, as
      though with anxious care he sought to give it, by way of compensation for
      its delivery by mere instruments, the depth of feeling and ardour which
      lies at the source of the human voice as the expression of the
      unfathomable depths of the heart.<a href="#linknote34-45"
      name="linknoteref34-45" id="linknoteref34-45"> 45 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p034.png">[34]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This result can only be attained by the most delicate appreciation of the
      various capacities of each individual instrument. The very diversity of
      tone-colouring which characterises these symphonies shows the masterly
      hand with which Mozart chooses and blends his tones, so that every detail
      shall come to full effect. It would not be easy to find places in which
      the sound-effect does not correspond with the intention; as he imagined it
      and willed it, so it sounds, and the same certainty, the same moderation,
      is apparent in every part of the artistic construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Symphony in E flat major (543 K., part 3) is a veritable triumph of
      euphony. Mozart has employed clarinets here, and their union with the
      horns and bassoons produces that full, mellow tone which is so important
      an element in the modern orchestra; the addition of flutes gives it
      clearness and light, and trumpets endow it with brilliancy and freshness.
      It will suffice to remind the reader of the beautiful passage in the
      andante, where the wind instruments enter in imitation, or of the charming
      trio to the minuet, to make manifest the importance of the choice of
      tone-colouring in giving characteristic expression. We find the expression
      of perfect happiness in the exuberant charm of euphony, the brilliancy of
      maturest beauty in which these symphonies are, as it were, steeped,
      leaving such an impression as that made on the eye by the dazzling colours
      of a glorious summer day. How seldom is this unalloyed happiness and joy
      in living granted to mankind, how seldom does art succeed in reproducing
      it entire and pure, as it is in this symphony! The feeling of pride in the
      consciousness of power shines through the magnificent introduction, while
      the allegro expresses purest pleasure, now in frolicsome joy, now in
      active excitement, and now in noble and dignified composure. Some shadows
      appear, it is true, in the andante, but they only serve to throw into
      stronger relief the mild serenity of a <span class="side">G MINOR
      SYMPHONY, 1788.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p035.png">[35]</a></span>
      mind that communes with itself and rejoices in the peace which fills it.
      This is the true source of the cheerful transport which rules the last
      movement, rejoicing in its own strength and in the joy of being. The last
      movement in especial is full of a mocking joviality more frequent with
      Haydn than Mozart, but it does not lose its hold on the more refined and
      elevated tone of the preceding movements. This movement receives its
      peculiar stamp from its startling harmonic and rhythmical surprises. Thus
      it has an extremely comic effect when the wind instruments try to continue
      the subject begun by the violins, but because these pursue their way
      unheeding, are thrown out as it were, and break off in the middle. This
      mocking tone is kept up to the conclusion, which appears to Nägeli
      ("Vorlesungen," p. 158) "so noisily inconclusive" (<i>so stillos
      unschliessend</i>), "such a bang, that the unsuspecting hearer does not
      know what has happened to him."<a href="#linknote34-46"
      name="linknoteref34-46" id="linknoteref34-46"> 46 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The G minor symphony affords a complete contrast to all this (550 K., part
      2). Sorrow and complaining take the place of joy and gladness. The
      pianoforte quartet (composed August, 1785) and the Quintet (composed May
      16, 1787) in G minor are allied in tone, but their sorrow passes in the
      end to gladness or calm, whereas here it rises in a continuous climax to a
      wild merriment, as if seeking to stifle care. The agitated first movement
      begins with a low plaintiveness, which is scarcely interrupted by the
      calmer mood of the second subject;<a href="#linknote34-47"
      name="linknoteref34-47" id="linknoteref34-47"> 47 </a> the working-out of
      the second part intensifies the gentle murmur&mdash;[See Page Image] <span
      class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p036.png">[36]</a></span> into a piercing cry of anguish;
      but, strive and struggle as it may, the strength of the resistance sinks
      again into the murmur with which the movement closes. The andante, on the
      contrary, is consolatory in tone; not reposing on the consciousness of an
      inner peace, but striving after it with an earnest composure which even
      attempts to be cheerful.<a href="#linknote34-48" name="linknoteref34-48"
      id="linknoteref34-48"> 48 </a> The minuet introduces a new turn of
      expression. A resolute resistance is opposed to the foe, but in vain, and
      again the effort sinks to a moan. Even the tender comfort of the trio,
      softer and sweeter than the andante, fails to bring lasting peace; again
      the combat is renewed, and again it dies away, complaining. The last
      movement brings no peace, only a wild merriment that seeks to drown
      sorrow, and goes on its course in restless excitement. This is the most
      passionate of all Mozart's symphonies; but even in this he has not
      forgotten that "music, when expressing horrors, must still be music" (Vol.
      II., p. 239).<a href="#linknote34-49" name="linknoteref34-49"
      id="linknoteref34-49"> 49 </a> Goethe's words concerning the Laocoon are
      applicable here ("Werke" XXIV., p. 233): "We may boldly assert that this
      work exhausts its subject, and fulfils every condition of art. It teaches
      us that though the artist's feeling for beauty may be stirred by calm and
      simple subjects, it is only displayed in its highest grandeur and dignity
      when it proves its power of depicting varieties of character, and of
      throwing moderation and control into its representations of outbreaks of
      human passion." And in the same sense in which Goethe ventured to call the
      Laocoon graceful, none can deny the grace of this symphony, in spite of
      much harshness and <span class="side">C MAJOR SYMPHONY.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p037.png">[37]</a></span> keenness of
      expression.<a href="#linknote34-50" name="linknoteref34-50"
      id="linknoteref34-50"> 50 </a> The nature of the case demands the
      employment of quite other means to those of the E flat major symphony. The
      outlines are more sharply defined and contrasted, without the abundant
      filling-in of detail which are of such excellent effect in the earlier
      work, the result being a greater clearness, combined with a certain amount
      of severity and harshness. The instrumentation agrees with it; it is kept
      within confined limits, and has a sharp, abrupt character. The addition of
      clarinets for a later performance gave the tone-colouring greater
      intensity and fulness. Mozart has taken an extra sheet of paper, and has
      rearranged the original oboe parts, giving characteristic passages to the
      clarinets, others to the oboes alone, and frequently combining the two. No
      clarinets were added to the minuet. Again, of a totally distinct character
      is the last symphony, in C major (551 K., part 4), in more than one
      respect the greatest and best, although neither so full of passion as the
      G minor symphony, nor so full of charm as the E flat major.<a
      href="#linknote34-51" name="linknoteref34-51" id="linknoteref34-51"> 51
      </a> Most striking is the dignity and solemnity of the whole work,
      manifested in the brilliant pomp in the first movement, with its evident
      delight in splendid sound-effects.:
    </p>
    <p>
      It has no passionate excitement, but its tender grace is heightened by a
      serenity which shines forth most unmistakably in the subject already
      alluded to (Vol. II., p. 455, cf. p. 334), which occurs unexpectedly at
      the close of the first part. The andante reveals the very depths of
      feeling, with traces in its calm beauty of the passionate agitation and
      strife from which it proceeds; the impression it leaves is one of moral
      strength, <span class="side">MOZART'S INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p038.png">[38]</a></span> perfected to a
      noble gentleness. The minuet recalls to mind the cheerful subject of the
      first movement. There is an elastic spring in its motion, sustained with a
      delicacy and refinement which transports the hearer into a purer element,
      where he seems to exist without effort, like the Homeric gods. The finale
      is that masterpiece of marvellous contrapuntal art, which leaves even upon
      the uninitiated the impression of a magnificent princely pageant, to
      prepare the mind for which has been the office of the previous movements.
      We recognise in the principal subject which opens the movement&mdash;[See
      Page Images]
    </p>
    <p>
      the motif of which Mozart made frequent use even in his youth (Vol. I., p.
      259); here he seems anxious to bid it a final farewell. He takes it again
      as a fugue subject, and again inverted:&mdash;

    <p>
      Then other motifs join in. One, in pregnant rhythm&mdash;

      connected with a third motif as a concluding section:&mdash;

      ideas, both as independent elements for <span class="side">SYMPHONIES.</span>

      contrapuntal elaboration, and in two, three, or fourfold combinations,
      bringing to pass harmonic inflections of great force and boldness,
      sometimes even of biting harshness. There is scarcely a phrase, however
      insignificant, which does not make good its independent existence.<a

    <p>
      The perfection of the art of counterpoint is not the distinguishing
      characteristic of this symphony alone, but of them all. The enthralling
      interest of the development of each movement in its necessary connection
      and continuity consists chiefly in the free and liberal use of the
      manifold resources of counterpoint. The ease and certainty of this mode of
      expression makes it seem fittest for what the composer has to say. Freedom
      of treatment penetrates every component part of the whole, producing the
      independent, natural motion of each. The then novel art of employing the
      wind instruments in separate and combined effects was especially admired
      by Mozart's contemporaries. His treatment of the stringed instruments
      showed a progress not less advanced, as, for instance, in the free
      treatment of the basses, as characteristic as it was melodious. The
      highest quality of the symphonies, however, is their harmony of
      tone-colour, the healthy combination of orchestral sound, which is not to
      be replaced by any separate effects, however charming. In this combination
      consists the art of making the orchestra as a living organism express the
      artistic idea which gives the creative impulse to the work, and controls
      the forces which are always ready to be set in motion. An unerring
      conception of the capacities for development <span class="side">MOZART'S
      INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p040.png">[40]</a></span> contained in each subject, of the
      relations of contrasting and conflicting elements, of the proportions of
      the parts composing the different movements,<a href="#linknote34-54"
      name="linknoteref34-54" id="linknoteref34-54"> 54 </a> and of the
      proportions of the movements to the whole work; finally, of the proper
      division and blending of the tone-colours&mdash;such are the essential
      conditions for the production of a work of art which is to be effective in
      all its parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few persons will wish to dispute the fact that Mozart's great symphonies
      display the happiest union of invention and knowledge, of feeling and
      taste. We have endeavoured also to show in brief outline that they are the
      characteristic expression of a mind tuned to artistic production, whence
      their entire organisation of necessity proceeds. But language, incapable
      of rendering the impressions made by the formative arts, is still more
      impotent in seeking to reproduce the substance of a musical work.<a
      href="#linknote34-55" name="linknoteref34-55" id="linknoteref34-55"> 55
      </a> Points that can be readily apprehended are emphasised
      disproportionately; and the subjectivity of the speaker or writer intrudes
      itself upon the consideration of the music. It has been lately questioned,
      for instance, whether Mozart's compositions were the absolute and
      necessary results of certain definite frames of mind, and a comparison has
      been made between him and Beethoven upon this point. If it is intended by
      this to draw attention to Beethoven's art, as proceeding from his <i>spiritual</i>
      being (Geist), in contrast to that of earlier composers&mdash;of Mozart
      especially&mdash;which came from the <i>mind</i> (Seele),<a
      href="#linknote34-56" name="linknoteref34-56" id="linknoteref34-56"> 56
      </a> an important point is indicated. But if this distinction is made
      exhaustive, or essentially qualitative, the right point of view is thereby
      disturbed. There can be no doubt that Beethoven has struck chords in the
      human mind which none before him had touched&mdash;that <span class="side">THE
      RIGHT MEANING OF THE SYMPHONIES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p041.png">[41]</a></span> he employs the means at his
      command with a power and energy of expression unheard before; that by him&mdash;the
      true son of his time&mdash;the strife of passions and the struggle for
      individual freedom are more powerfully and unhesitatingly expressed than
      by any of his predecessors. But human nature remains the same, and the
      genuine impulses of artistic creation proceed from universal and
      unalterable laws; the artist does but impress his individual stamp upon
      the composing elements of his work; and if, under certain circumstances,
      this should fail to be comprehended, it does not therefore follow that the
      work has no meaning.<a href="#linknote34-57" name="linknoteref34-57"
      id="linknoteref34-57"> 57 </a> For neither can the form and the substance
      of a veritable work of art be divided or substituted the one for the
      other, nor can such a work take effect as a whole when it is not accepted
      and grasped in all its parts.<a href="#linknote34-58"
      name="linknoteref34-58" id="linknoteref34-58"> 58 </a> It is this
      wholeness, this oneness, which brings the mind of the artist most clearly
      before us. Let it be remembered that Mozart's contemporaries dis-; covered
      an exaggerated expression of emotion and an incomprehensible depth of
      characterisation in those very compositions in which our age recognises
      dignified moderation, pure harmony, perfect beauty, and a graceful
      treatment of form sometimes even to the loss of intrinsic force; and it
      will be acknowledged that much which was supposed to depend on the
      construction of the work lies really in the changing point of view of the
      hearers. Those only who come to the consideration of the work with a clear
      and unbiased mind, taking their standard from the universal and
      unchangeable laws of art&mdash;those only who are capable of grasping the
      individuality of an artistic nature, will not go astray either in their
      appreciation or their criticism.

      CHAPTER XXXV. MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE unexampled success of the "Entführung," which brought fame to the
      composer and pecuniary gain<span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p042.png">[42]</a></span> to the theatrical management,
      justified Mozart in his expectation that the Emperor, having called German
      opera into existence,<a href="#linknote35-1" name="linknoteref35-1"
      id="linknoteref35-1"> 1 </a> would commission him to further its
      prosperous career. He was indeed offered an opera, but the libretto,
      ''Welches ist die beste Nation?" was such miserable trash, that Mozart
      would not waste his music on it. Umlauf composed it, but it was hissed off
      the stage; and Mozart wrote to his father (December 21, 1782) that he did
      not know whether the poet or the composer were most deserving of the
      condemnation the work received. In fact, the impulse given to German opera
      seemed only too likely to die away without lasting result. Stephanie the
      younger<a href="#linknote35-2" name="linknoteref35-2" id="linknoteref35-2">
      2 </a> contrived by his intrigues to obtain the dismissal of Müller as
      conductor of the opera, and the appointment of a committee, whose
      jealousies and party feelings he turned so skilfully to account that they
      were all speedily satisfied to leave the actual power in his hands. The
      incessant disagreements which were the consequence, the hostility between
      composers, actors, and musicians, disgusted Kienmayer and Rosenberg, the
      managers of the opera, and the Emperor himself. Nor were the repeated
      experiments made with the works of mediocre <span class="side">THE OPERA
      IN VIENNA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p043.png">[43]</a></span>
      composers (which so enraged Mozart that he purposed writing a critique on
      them with examples) likely to find favour with the Emperor. Add to this
      that his immediate musical surroundings, Salieri at the head of them, were
      at least passively opposed to German opera, and it will not be thought
      surprising that the Emperor Joseph angrily renounced German opera, and
      followed his own taste in the reinstalment of the Italian. Chance brought
      this determination to a point. A French company of considerable merit,
      both in opera and the drama, was performing at the Kamthnerthortheater,
      and was patronised by the Emperor.<a href="#linknote35-3"
      name="linknoteref35-3" id="linknoteref35-3"> 3 </a> He sent for the
      performers to Schönbrunn in the summer of
    </p>
    <p>
      1782, and entertained them in the castle during their stay. They were
      dissatisfied with the hospitality they there received, and one of the
      actors had the ill-breeding, during a meal at which the Emperor happened
      to come in, to offer him a glass of wine, with the request that he would
      try it, and say whether such wretched Burgundy was good enough for them to
      drink. The Emperor drank the wine, and answered that it was good enough
      for him, but he had no doubt they would find better wine in France.<a
      href="#linknote35-4" name="linknoteref35-4" id="linknoteref35-4"> 4 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the dismissal of this company, Count Rosenberg was commissioned to
      engage the best singers in Italy, male and female, for an opera buffa,
      which was all that was then thought feasible; and at the end of the
      carnival of 1783 the German opera company was dissolved, its best members
      associating themselves with the new Italian company.<a href="#linknote35-5"
      name="linknoteref35-5" id="linknoteref35-5"> 5 </a> Under these
      circumstances there was not much hope of success for German operatic

      Yesterday my opera was given for the seventeenth time with the usual
      applause, and to a crowded house. Next Friday a new opera is to be given,
      the music an absurdity (Galimathias) by a young pupil of Wagenseil's
    </p>
    <p>
      (Joh. Mederitsch), called "Gallus cantans in abore sedens gigirigi
      faciens." It will probably fail, but perhaps not so completely as its
      predecessor, an old opera by Gassmann," "La Notte Critica" ("The Disturbed
      Night"), which was scarcely brought to a third performance. Before this
      there was Umlaufs execrable opera, which only reached a second. It is as
      though, knowing that German opera is to die after Easter, they wanted to
      hasten its end by their own act: and they are Germans&mdash;confound them!&mdash;who
      do this. My own opinion is, that Italian opera will not survive long, and
      I shall always hold to the German; I prefer it, although it is certainly
      more trouble. Every nation has its opera, why should we Germans not have
      ours? Is not our language as fit for singing as the French and English?
      and more so than the Russian? Well, I am writing a German opera all <i>for
      myself</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have chosen as subject Goldoni's comedy "Il Servitore di Due Padroni,"
      and the first act is already translated&mdash;the translator being Baron
      Binder! But it is to be a secret until it is finished. Now, what do you
      think of that? Don't you think that I shall do myself some good by it?
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be little doubt that his father would have answered this
      question in the affirmative, but he would have been more sceptical as to
      the feasibility of the plan, and practical considerations seem to have
      caused its abandonment. Two German airs, preserved in draft score, belong
      by their handwriting to this period; one for a tenor (indicated as Carl),
      "Müsst ich auch durch tausend Drachen" (435 K.), and the other for a bass
      (Wahrmond), "Manner suchen stets zu naschen" (433 K.). No dramatic
      situation is recognisable, and it cannot therefore be affirmed that they
      were composed for this opera. The composition of a German opera for which
      he afterwards received a commission from Mannheim came to nothing. Klein
      sent him a libretto (doubtless "Rudolf von Habsburg")<a
      href="#linknote35-7" name="linknoteref35-7" id="linknoteref35-7"> 7 </a>
      with the request that he would set it to music, whereupon Mozart answered
      (March 21, 1785):<a href="#linknote35-8" name="linknoteref35-8"

      I ought certainly to have acknowledged before now the receipt of your
      letter and the accompanying parcel; but it is not the case that I have in
      the meantime received two other letters from you; if so, I should
      certainly have remembered to answer your first as I now do, having
      received your other two letters on the last post-day. But I should have
      had no more to say to you on the subject of the opera than I now have. My
      dear sir, my hands are so full of work that I have not a moment to myself.
      You know by experience, even better than I, that a thing of this sort must
      be read carefully and attentively several times over. Hitherto I have not
      been able to read it once without interruption. All that I can say at
      present is, that I should like to keep the piece a little longer, if you
      will be kind enough to leave it with me. In case I should feel disposed to
      set it to music, I should wish to know beforehand whether it is intended
      for performance at any particular place? For such a work ought not to be
      left to chance. I shall hope for an explanation on this point from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasons for the final rejection of this opera are unknown. Mozart's
      account of the position of German opera in Vienna is very characteristic.
      In 1784, it was almost extinct; only Madame Lange selected the
      "Entführung" for her benefit on January 25, conducted by Mozart himself
      (Wiener Zeitung, 1784, No. 7); and Adamberger gave Gluck's "Pilgrimme von
      Mecca" on February 15. Besides these, Benda's melodramas, "Ariadne" and
      "Medea," Jacquet's chief characters, were performed a few times. But when
      in the following year the desire for German opera revived, it was decided
      to reappoint the Kamthnerthortheater, which had been freed from its
      connection with the court, and to reinstate the German opera in
      competition with the Italian. On this point Mozart continues:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I can give you no present information as to the intended German opera, as
      (with the exception of the alterations at the Karnthnerthor-theater)
      everything goes on very quietly. It is to be opened at the beginning of
      October. I do not prophesy a very prosperous result. It seems to me that
      the plans now formed are more likely to end in the final overthrow of the
      temporarily depressed German opera, than in its elevation and support. My
      sister-in-law Lange alone is to be allowed to join the German company.
      Cavalieri, Adamberger, Teyber, all pure Germans, of whom our fatherland
      may be proud, are to stay in the Italian theatre, to oppose and rival
      their own countrymen. German singers at present may be easily counted! And
      even if they be as good <span class="side">MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p046.png">[46]</a></span> as those
      I have named, which I very much doubt, the present management appears to
      me too economical and too little patriotic to think of paying the services
      of strangers, when they can have as good or better on the spot. The
      Italian <i>troupe</i> has no need of them in point of numbers; it can
      stand alone. The present idea is to employ <i>acteurs and actrices</i> for
      the German opera who sing from need; unfortunately the very men are
      retained as the <i>directeurs</i> of the theatre and the orchestra who
      have contributed by their want of knowledge and energy to the downfall of
      their own edifice. If only a single patriot were to come to the fore, it
      would give the affair another aspect. But in that case, perhaps, the
      budding national theatre would break forth into blossom; and what a
      disgrace it would be to Germany if we Germans once began in earnest to
      think, or act, or speak and even&mdash;to <i>sing</i> German! Do not blame
      me, my dear sir, if I go too far in my zeal. Convinced that I am
      addressing a fellow <i>German</i>, I give my tongue free course, which
      unfortunately is so seldom possible that after such an outpouring of the
      heart one feels that one might get drunk without any risk of injuring
      one's health.

      The performances of the new German opera, which opened on October 16,
      1785, with Monsigny's "Félix," were in no respect equal to those of the
      Italian opera. Mozart, whose "Entführung" maintained its place in the
      repertory until March, 1788, when the house was again closed, was not
      further employed as composer.<a href="#linknote35-9" name="linknoteref35-9"
      id="linknoteref35-9"> 9 </a> Only on one occasion did the Emperor seem to
      recollect that Mozart was the only opera composer of German birth who
      could rival the Italian Salieri. At a "Festival in honour of the
      Governor-General of the Netherlands," dramatic performances were commanded
      by the Emperor in the Orangery at Schönbrunn, on February 7, 1796; the
      most distinguished actors and singers, both Italian and German, were
      engaged.<a href="#linknote35-10" name="linknoteref35-10"
      id="linknoteref35-10"> 10 </a> Stephanie junior was commissioned to
      prepare the German occasional <span class="side">DER SCHAUSPIELDIRECTOR,
      1786.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p047.png">[47]</a></span>
      piece; it was called "Der Schauspieldirector."<a href="#linknote35-11"
      name="linknoteref35-11" id="linknoteref35-11"> 11 </a> The dramatis
      persona were as follows:&mdash;[See Page Image]

    <p>
      The plot consists in the difficulties of Frank, the manager, in engaging a
      company for a theatre he has received permission to open in Salzburg. Many
      actors and actresses offer their services, and perform favourite scenes by
      way of testing their ability, the piece concluding with a similar trial of
      operatic music. The piece was loosely put together, and its main interest
      consisted in allusions to the passing events in the theatrical world;
      these are sometimes too palpable and rather coarse. Casti's little Italian
      opera, written for the same occasion, "Prima la Musica e poi le Parole"
      is, on the contrary, really witty and amusing, and allows the composer
      scope for a genuine musical work. Salieri, whose music, according to
      Mozart, was tolerable, but nothing more,<a href="#linknote35-12"
      name="linknoteref35-12" id="linknoteref35-12"> 12 </a> thus gained a great
      advantage over Mozart, to whom was entrusted the musical portion of the
      German piece. There could here, of course, be no question of dramatic
      interest and individual characterisation. The two singers bring their airs
      with them as prepared trials of skill. The object was to mark the contrast
      between them. The two songs are alike in design, with one slow and one
      agitated movement, and they further resemble each other in their mixture
      of sentimentality and gaiety, and in the number of bravura passages, <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p048.png">[48]</a></span> which sometimes go to a
      considerable height. It is in the details that everything is different,
      even to the instrumentation, and that the sharpest possible contrast is
      maintained both in the parts and style of delivery. There is no great
      liveliness of movement until&mdash;the manager being perplexed to make his
      choice between the two&mdash;they fall to quarrelling, each of them
      reiterating with increasing warmth: "Ich bin die beste Sangerin."
      Thereupon the tenor comes to the rescue, and seeks to allay the irritation
      of the enraged ladies, giving occasion for a comic terzet full of life and
      humour. This was composed by Mozart, probably because it amused him, on
      January 18, 1786, although the play was not finished until February 3.
      Although the situation in itself cannot be said to possess much interest,
      there is a certain charm in the piece, and the forms which are usually
      only of artistic significance have here a substantial basis. The
      imitations with which the singers follow on each other's heels, the
      passages in which they run up to a fabulous height, the alternation of
      rapid <i>parlando</i> with affected delivery and extraordinary passages&mdash;all
      these not only take effect as means of dramatic characterisation, but give
      the hearers the pleasure of deciding for themselves which of the two
      aspirants really is the best singer. The peacemaking tenor attaches.,
      himself now to one, now to the other singer, and then again opposes them
      both, giving a certain amount of dignity to the dispute by means of
      musical and dramatic contrasts. Indeed the whole scene is so lively, so
      gay, so free from caricature, and so euphonious, that the terzet may well
      claim a place with more important works. The concluding operatic piece is
      a vaudeville. Each solo voice delivers a verse of the song, passing with
      characteristic modifications into the principal motif, which takes the
      form of a chorus. The bass voice comes last; the actor Buf gives his
      decision for the first buffo. This was Lange, who himself used to say that
      he could only make a singer at need (Selbtsbiographie, p. 126), and who
      thus ironically parodied his own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart also wrote an overture to the piece, in which, less bound by the
      triviality of the text, he could move more <span class="side">DER
      SCHAUSPIELDIRECTOR, 1786.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p049.png">[49]</a></span> freely. It consists of a single
      movement in quick time. The first bars&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      fall at once into the tone of the whole, and form in their contrasting
      elements the motifs which are afterwards intersected in the working-out.
      The two subsequent better-sustained melodies possess in their easy
      imitative movement, the charm of a lively, excited conversation, the
      transition passage forming a piquant contrast; in short, the whole
      overture resembles a comedy with the different characters and intrigues
      crossing each other, until at last all ends well. The whole festival was
      twice repeated at the Kamthnerthortheater soon after the performance at
      Schönbrunn.<a href="#linknote35-13" name="linknoteref35-13"
      id="linknoteref35-13"> 13 </a>
    </p>

      Several later attempts were made to give the piece more action and more
      music, so as to preserve Mozart's work on the stage.

    <p>
      When Goethe undertook the management of the court theatre at Weimar in
      1791, numerous Italian and French operas were arranged to German words by
      the indefatigable concertmeister Kranz and the industrious theatrical
      poet, Vulpius.<a href="#linknote35-14" name="linknoteref35-14"
      id="linknoteref35-14"> 14 </a> Goethe, being in Rome in the summer of

      id="linknoteref35-15"> 15 </a> which Cimarosa had composed in the Carnival

      afterwards repeated with alterations<a href="#linknote35-18"

      In Vienna, after the operetta had again been thrice performed in 1797, an
      experiment was made in 1814 with an increased adaptation by Stegmeyer, but
      without lasting success.<a href="#linknote35-19" name="linknoteref35-19"
      id="linknoteref35-19"> 19 </a> Within the last few years L. Schneider has

      id="linknoteref35-20"> 20 </a> Wishing to preserve Mozart's music free

      </a> But in order to give the plot more interest he fell into the

      under Schikaneder's direction. It is incredible that any one should have
      been capable of thus misrepresenting the master whom the resuscitation of
      his music was intended to honour, as a senseless, infatuated coxcomb,
      contemptible both in his obsequious submission to Schikaneder and his
      immoral relations with his sister-in-law, Aloysia Lange. In 1856 Mozart's
      operetta was given in Paris at the Bouffes Parisiens with great success;
      but with what adaptations I am not aware.

      Mozart was altogether deceived in his expectation that the Italian opera
      would not find favour with the public. Joseph made himself acquainted
      through Salieri with all the most distinguished artists whom the latter
      had heard in Italy (Mosel, Salieri, p. 75), and gave him full power to
      engage those he thought fit; he even made this a special object of his own
      journey through Italy. He thus succeeded in bringing together a <i>personnel</i>
      for opera buffa, which through a long series of years, with various
      changes, was unsurpassed in the <span class="side">REVIVAL OF ITALIAN

      mentioned Vienna singers who went over to the Italian opera, Lange,
      Cavalieri, and Teyber, were joined by Bemasconi, already past her prime,
      in honour of whom Gluck's "Iphigenie in Tauris" was performed in Italian,
      in December, 1783.<a href="#linknote35-23" name="linknoteref35-23"
      id="linknoteref35-23"> 23 </a> From Italy came Nancy Storace, Mandini, and
      afterwards Celestine Coltellini. Of the German male singers they had
      indeed dismissed Fischer, whose loss Mozart rightly declared to be
      irreparable, but in Benucci they acquired a bass buffo of the first rank.
      True, he left Vienna the same year, but Marchesini, who replaced him, was
      not nearly so popular, and Benucci was recalled the following year. The
      baritones were Mandini, Bussani, and Pugnetti, together with the tenor,
      O'Kelly (Kelly), and the Germans, Adamberger, Saal, and Ruprecht. On April
      22, 1783, the Italian opera was opened with Salieri's newly adapted opera
      "La Scuola dei Gelosi."<a href="#linknote35-24" name="linknoteref35-24"
      id="linknoteref35-24"> 24 </a> It was a decided success, and was repeated
      twenty-five times, although a cold criticism of the opening night asserts:
      "The prima donna sang extremely well, but her gesticulation is
      intolerable. The buffo bore away the palm for natural acting. The other
      performers are unworthy of notice."<a href="#linknote35-25"
      name="linknoteref35-25" id="linknoteref35-25"> 25 </a> The next opera, by
      Cimarosa, "L' Italiana in Londra" (May 5), was not so well received; but
      on the other hand Sarti's opera, "Fra due Litiganti il Terzo Gode" (May
      25) excited extraordinary enthusiasm.<a href="#linknote35-26"
      name="linknoteref35-26" id="linknoteref35-26"> 26 </a> Schroder writes on

      id="linknoteref35-27"> 27 </a> Earnestly as Mozart desired to be employed
      upon a German opera, he could not fail to be excited by the performances
      and success of the Italian opera, and his overpowering love of the drama
      urged him again to employ his genius in the field best fitted for its
      efforts. He writes to his father (May 7, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian opera has recommenced, and pleases very much. The buffo, named
      Benucci, is particularly good. I have looked through at least a hundred
      (indeed more) ibretti, but cannot find one satisfactory&mdash;that is,
      unless much were to be altered. And a poet would often rather write a new
      one than alter&mdash;indeed the new one is sure to be better. We have here
      a certain Abbate da Ponte as poet; he is driven frantic with the
      alterations he has to make for the theatre; he is, <i>per obligo</i>,
      employed on a new libretto for Salieri, and will be at least two months
      over it;<a href="#linknote35-28" name="linknoteref35-28"
      id="linknoteref35-28"> 28 </a> then he has promised to do something new
      for me. But who knows whether he can or will keep his word? You know how
      fair-spoken the Italians are! If he tells Salieri about it, I shall get no
      opera as long as I live&mdash;and I should like to show what I can do in
      Italian music. Sometimes I have thought that if Varesco does not bear
      malice on account of the Munich opera he might write me a new book for
      seven characters&mdash;but you know best if that can be done. He might be
      writing down his ideas, and we could work them out together in Salzburg.
      The essential point is that the whole thing should be very comic and, if
      possible, that it should have two good female parts&mdash;one seria, the
      other mezzo carattere, but both equal in importance. The third female
      might be quite buffa, and all the male parts if necessary. If you think
      anything can be done with Varesco, please speak to him very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of inducement to Varesco, he sent him word that he might reckon on
      a fee of four or five hundred gulden, for that it was customary in Vienna
      to give the poet the receipts of the third representation. Some time after
      he asks again (June 7, 1783)
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know nothing of Varesco? I beg you not to forget; if I were in
      Salzburg we could work at it together so well, if we had a plan ready
      prepared.

    <p>
      Before Mozart went to Salzburg he had an instance of what he might expect
      in the opposition made to the insertion of his two airs for Adamberger and
      Madame Lange in <span class="side">L' OCA DEL CAIRO, 1783.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p053.png">[53]</a></span> Anfossi's
      "Curioso Indiscreto" (Vol. II., p. 326). On his arrival in Salzburg at the
      end of July, he found Varesco quite ready for the undertaking, which was
      to begin at once, and to be completed in Salzburg.

      Among Mozart's remains were found in Varesco's handwriting the first act
      complete, and the prose table of contents in detail of the second and
      third acts of the opera "L' Oca del Cairo" ("The Goose of Cairo"). The <i>dramatis
      personæ</i> are as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents are briefly these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pippo, Marchese di Ripasecca, a vain and haughty fool, has by his
      ill-treatment forced his wife, Donna Pantea, to leave him; he believes her
      dead, but she is living, concealed at a place over the seas. Biondello,
      hated by him, loves his daughter Celidora, whom he intends to marry to
      Count Lionetto di Casavuota; he himself has fallen in love with her
      companion Lavina, who has come to an understanding with Calandrino,
      Biondello's friend and Pantea's relative. The two maidens are confined in
      a fortified tower and closely guarded. In full conviction of his security,
      Don Pippo has been induced to promise Biondello that if he succeeds in
      gaining access to Celidora within the year, her hand shall be his reward.
      Hereupon, Calandrino, a skilful mechanic, has constructed an artificial
      goose large enough to contain a man, and with machinery capable of motion;
      this is conveyed to Pantea, who, disguised in Moorish costume, is to
      display it as a show; it is hoped that Pippo may consent to its exhibition
      before the two maidens, and that Biondello may thus be conveyed into the
      tower. As a condition Calandrino exacts from his friend a promise of
      Lavina's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera begins on the anniversary of the wager. Don Pippo is about to
      marry Lavina, and awaits the arrival of Count Lionetto; his house is
      filled with preparations for festivity. The curtain rises on the whole
      household, including the coquettish maid Auretta and her lover the
      house-steward, Chichibio, having their hair dressed. Calandrino <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p054.png">[54]</a></span> enters in much perturbation;
      Pantea has not arrived, and a violent storm gives rise to the fear that
      she may fail altogether; some other device must be hit upon. He promises
      marriage to Chichibio and Auretta, if they can succeed in abstracting Don
      Pippo's clothes, and preventing his leaving the castle, which they
      undertake. The scene changes: Celidora and Lavina are conversing on a
      terrace on the fourth story of the tower, to which they have obtained
      access in secret; the lovers appear below on the other side of the moat,
      and a tender quartet is carried on. The new plan is to throw a bridge
      across the moat and scale the tower. Workmen arrive and the task is
      eagerly commenced; but Chichibio and Auretta, chattering about their
      marriage, have failed to keep watch, and now announce that Don Pippo has
      gone out; he himself speedily appears, summons the watch, stops the work,
      and drives away the lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second act Pantea lands with the goose in a violent storm. It is a
      fair-day, and the assembled people are full of amazement at the natural
      and rational movements of the goose, which is supposed to come from Cairo.
      Auretta and Chichibio inform Don Pippo of the wonderful sight. He causes
      Pantea to come forward, and she informs him that the goose having lost its
      speech from fright during the storm can only be restored by the use of a
      certain herb growing in a lonely garden. Don Pippo, delighted, commissions
      Calandrino to take Pantea and the goose into the pleasure-garden, that so
      the two maidens may enjoy the spectacle. The finale represents the fair
      close to the tower, the two ladies looking on from the window. A dispute
      arises, in which Biondello takes part; Don Pippo, as magistrate, is called
      on to do justice; some ridiculous action is carried on, ending in a
      general tumult. Pantea then puts Biondello into the goose and enters the
      garden, while Calandrino informs Don Pippo that Biondello, in despair, has
      set out to sea in a small boat, which is confirmed by the weeping Auretta.
      Don Pippo, in high delight, forms a ludicrous wedding procession and
      proceeds to the tower, where Celidora and Lavina stand at the window while
      the goose makes various antics for the amusement of the crowd. Finally,
      Don Pippo appears in the great hall of the tower, accompanied by the two
      maidens and the goose, in full confidence of his triumph, and only waiting
      the arrival of Count Lionetto to celebrate the wedding. Chichibio enters
      with an uncourteous refusal from the Count. As Don Pippo is in the act of
      giving his hand to Lavina, Pantea advances in her true person, the goose
      begins to speak, opens, and Biondello steps out; Don Pippo is beside
      himself, and is ridiculed by them all; he ends by promising to amend his
      ways, and the three couples are made happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt this summarised account has omitted to take note of many comic
      and effective touches; but on the other hand it has suppressed many
      absurdities&mdash;the general impression of a fantastic and senseless plot
      not being affected <span class="side">L'OCA DEL CAIRO, 1783.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p055.png">[55]</a></span> by the
      treatment of the details. In the first glow of delight at having a new
      libretto, Mozart set to work composing at once in Salzburg, and after his
      return to Vienna he anticipated different scenes that interested him; but
      he was soon seized with misgivings that the opera could not be put on the
      stage without important alterations. He wrote on the subject to his father
      (December 6, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Only three more airs, and the first act of my opera is finished. With the
      aria buffa, the quartet, and the finale I can safely say I am perfectly
      satisfied&mdash;in fact, quite delighted. So that I should be sorry to
      have written so much good music in vain, which must be the case unless
      some indispensable alterations are made. Neither you, nor the Abbate
      Varesco, nor I, reflected that it would have a very bad effect&mdash;indeed,
      would ruin the opera&mdash;if neither of the two principal female
      characters were to appear on the stage until the last moment, but were to
      be always wandering about on the ramparts or terraces of the tower. One
      act of this might pass muster, but I am sure the audience would not stand
      a second. This objection first occurred to me in Linz, and I see no way
      out of it but to make some scenes of the second act take place in the
      fortress&mdash;<i>camera della fortezza</i>. The scene where Don Pippo
      gives orders to bring the goose in might be the room in which Celidora and
      Lavina are. Pantea comes in with the goose. Biondello pops out; they hear
      Don Pippo coming. In goes Biondello again. This would give an opening for
      a good quintet, which would be all the more comic because the goose sings
      too. I must confess to you, however, that my only reason for not objecting
      to the whole of the goose business is that two men of such penetration and
      judgment as yourself and Varesco see nothing against it. But there would
      still be time to think of something else. Biondello has only undertaken to
      make his way into the tower; whether he does it as a sham goose, or by any
      other trick, makes no difference at all. I cannot help thinking that many
      more comic and more natural scenes might be brought about if Biondello
      were to remain in human form. For instance, the news that Biondello had
      committed himself to the waves in despair, might arrive quite at the
      beginning of the second act, and he might then disguise himself as a Turk,
      or something of the kind, and bring Pantea in as a slave (Moorish, of
      course). Don Pippo is anxious to purchase a slave for his wife; and the
      slave-dealer and the Mooress are admitted into the fortress for
      inspection. This leads to much cajoling and mockery of her husband on the
      part of Pantea, which would improve the part, for the more comic the opera
      is the better. I hope you will explain my opinion fully to the Abbate
      Varesco, and I must beg him to set to work in earnest. I have worked hard
      enough in the short time. Indeed, I should have finished the first act, if
      I did not require some alterations made in some of the words; but I would
      rather you did not mention this to him at present.
    </p>

      <span class="side">MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p056.png">[56]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the postcript he again begs his father to consult Varesco, and hurry
      him on. On further consideration, however, he thought he had still
      conceded too much, and a few days afterwards he wrote (December 10, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Do all you can to make my book a success. I should like to bring the
      ladies down from the ramparts in the first act, when they sing their airs,
      and I would willingly allow them to sing the whole finale upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varesco was quite willing to make the alteration, which was easily to be
      effected by a change of scene. The altered version exists, together with
      the original text; but we know nothing further on the subject. Mozart
      seems to have made more extensive demands. He wrote to his father
      (December 24, 1783):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for what is most necessary with regard to the opera. The Abbate
      Varesco has written after Lavina's cavatina: "A cui serverà la musica
      della cavatina antecedente"&mdash;that is of Celidora's cavatina&mdash;but
      this will not do. The words of Celidora's cavatina are hopeless and
      inconsolable, while those of Lavina's are full of hope and consolation.
      Besides, making one character pipe a song after another is quite an
      exploded fashion, and never was a popular one. At the best it is only
      fitted for a soubrette and her lover in the <i>ultime parti.</i> My idea
      would be to begin the scene with a good duet, for which the same words,
      with a short appendix for the coda, would answer very well. After the
      duet, the conversation could proceed as before: "E quando s' ode il
      cam-panello della custode." Mademoiselle Lavina will have the goodness to
      take her departure instead of Celidora, so that the latter, as prima
      donna, may have an opportunity of singing a grand bravura air. This would,
      I think, be an improvement for the composer, the singers, and the
      audience, and the whole scene would gain in interest. Besides, it is
      scarcely likely that the same song would be tolerated from the second
      singer after being sung by the first. I do not know what you both mean by
      the following direction: At the end of the interpolated scene for the two
      women in the first act, the Abbate has written: "Siegue la scena VIII che
      prima era la VII e cosi cangiansi di mano in mano i numeri." This leads me
      to suppose that he intends the scene after the quartet, where the two
      ladies, one after the other, sing their little songs from the window, to
      remain. But that is impossible. The act would be lengthened out of all
      proportion, and quite spoiled. I always thought it ludicrous to read: <i>Celidora</i>.
      "Tu qui m' attendi, arnica. Alla custode farmi veder vogl' io; ci andrai
      tu puoi." Lavina: "Si dolce arnica, addio." (Celidora parte.) Lavina sings
      her song. Celidora comes back and says: "Eccomi, or vanne," &amp;c.; and
      then out goes Lavina, and Celidora sings her air; they relieve one
      another, like soldiers on guard. It is much more natural <span class="side">L'OCA
      DEL CAIRO, 1783.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p057.png">[57]</a></span>
      also that, being all together for the quartet, to arrange their
      contemplated attack, the men should go out to collect the necessary
      assistants, leaving the two women quietly in their retreat. All that can
      be allowed them is a few lines of recitative. I cannot imagine that it was
      intended to prolong the scene, only that the direction for closing it was
      omitted by mistake. I am very curious to hear your good idea for bringing
      Biondello into the tower; if it is only comical enough, we will overlook a
      good deal that may be unnatural. I am not at all afraid of a few
      fireworks; all the arrangements here are so good that there is no danger
      of fire. "Medea" has been given repeatedly, at the end of which half the
      palace falls in ruins while the other half is in flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Varesco refused to give up the "goose business," whether he was
      afraid of further endless emendations, or what his reasons were, who can
      tell? In any case no radical change was made in the text, and, much
      against his will, Mozart was forced to lay the opera aside. Besides a
      recitative and the cursory sketch of a tenor air, six numbers of the first
      act are preserved in draft score (422 K.), with, as usual, the voice parts
      and bass completely written out, and the ritornelli and accompaniment more
      or less exactly indicated for the different instruments. Four numbers
      belong to Auretta and Chichibio; the comparison with "Figaro" is an
      obvious one, and though Chichibio is far from being a Figaro, Auretta
      approaches much nearer to Susanna. The situation of her air (2) is not
      badly imagined. Calandrino, hearing from Auretta that Chichibio is very
      jealous, embraces her in jest and says, "What would Chichibio say if he
      saw us?" Thereupon that personage enters, and Auretta, pretending not to
      observe him, sings:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Se fosse qui nascoso
     Quell' Argo mio geloso,
     O, poverina me!

     Direbbe: "O maledetta,
     Pettegola, fraschetta!
     La fedeltà dov' è?"

     Pur sono innocente,
     Se fosse presente,
     Direbbe tra se:

     "O qui non c' è pericolo,

    </p>
    <p>
      The musical apprehension of the contrasts contained in the words is
      remarkably humorous and graceful, and especially the point to which the
      whole tends. "O qui non cè peri-colo" is as charmingly roguish as anything
      in "Figaro." Chichibio's comic air (3) is in the genuine style of Italian
      buffo, and consists of a rapid <i>parlando</i>; after the direction to
      close with the ritornello it acquires some originality of colour from the
      instrumentation. In the shorter of the two duets between Auretta and
      Chichibio, the orchestra was also intended to play a prominent part. The
      first duet (1), however, is more important and more broadly designed;
      Auretta provokes Chichibio's jealousy in the traditional manner, and then
      seeks to appease it. The whole piece, with its shifting humours, is lively
      and amusing, and the subject&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      carried out by the orchestra and toyed with by the voice-parts, is of a
      mingled grace and intensity truly worthy of Mozart. Then there are
      sketches of two great ensembles. The quartet (6) in which the lovers
      converse from afar has less of a buffo character and more true feeling;
      the two pairs of lovers are clearly distinguished, and their
      characteristics sharply defined. The finale (7), on the other hand, is
      altogether in the liveliest buffo tone. At the beginning the lovers are
      full of eagerness and hope at the building of the bridge, then follows the
      excitement of suspense, and when Don Pippo actually appears a general
      tumult breaks out. It does not lie in the nature of this situation to make
      the same display of rich variety, nor of the dignity of deep emotion,
      which we admire so much in other finales; it is calculated rather to
      excite wonder at the long continuation of spirited movement and ascending
      climax. In the last presto, especially, this is quite extraordinary; here
      the chorus (contrary to custom in comic opera) is independent and full of
      effect, yielding to no later work of the same kind. A proof of the figure
      Don Pippo is intended to cut is given in this <span class="side">LO SPOSO
      DELUSO, 1784.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p059.png">[59]</a></span>
      finale. The short andante maestoso, "Io sono offeso! La mia eccellenza, la
      prepotenza soffrir non de," indicates a grand buffo part such as never
      occurs in any other opera. We have, it is true, but a weak and shadowy
      outline of all these movements. Let the experiment be made of imagining
      corresponding numbers of "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni" deprived of all their
      orchestral parts except the bass, and a few bars to suggest the different
      motifs, and how much weaker and more colourless will be the image that
      remains! So, also, we can scarcely arrive at even an approximate idea of
      the life which Mozart would have thrown into these sketches when he came
      to work them out in all their detail and brilliancy of colouring. They
      betray, in common with all the works of this period, the firm touch of a
      master, and possess a singular interest to the student, even in their
      incomplete form. Who can say that Mozart, if he had finished the opera,
      would not have succeeded in overcoming the weaker points of the libretto?
      And yet he scarcely seems to have hoped as much himself, seeing that he
      finally laid aside the work, begun with so much eagerness and carried on
      so far. But he was far from abandoning his design, and seeing no immediate
      prospect of a new libretto, he selected from among the numerous books
      which he had collected one that he might at least hope to see put on the
      stage. This was "Lo Sposo Deluso" ("Der gefoppte Brautigam"), probably the
      same opera which was produced at Padua in the winter of 1787, with music
      by Cav. Pado.<a href="#linknote35-29" name="linknoteref35-29"
      id="linknoteref35-29"> 29 </a> That it was a libretto which had already
      been made use of follows from the fact that Mozart made some corrections
      from the original of inaccuracies as to names committed by the ignorant
      Italian copyist. It is not necessary for the comprehension of the portions
      composed by Mozart (430 K.) to transcribe the whole of the complicated
      contents of the book; the list of characters, with the names of the
      singers to whom Mozart alloted the various parts, will suffice to show the
      drift of the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>dramatis personæ</i>, then, are as follows:&mdash;[See Page Image]

    </p>
    <p>
      The time at which Mozart was at work on this libretto falls within that
      during which Nancy Storace performed as Signora Fischer. She had been
      induced to marry an English violinist, a Dr. Fisher, at Vienna, who
      ill-treated her, and was thereupon sent out of the country by the Emperor.
      This was in the year 1784,<a href="#linknote35-30" name="linknoteref35-30"
      id="linknoteref35-30"> 30 </a> and as Nancy Storace never afterwards bore
      the name of her husband, she could only have been so described by Mozart
      shortly after her marriage. As the opera begins, Bocconio, awaiting his
      bride, is discovered giving the finishing touches to his toilet; his
      friend Pulcherio, the woman-hater, is present, and jeers at him; so do Don
      Asdrubale and Bettina, who declares that if her uncle does not provide her
      with a husband without delay, she will give him and his wife no peace.
      While he is defending himself, the arrival of the bride is announced; the
      confusion increases, for he is not yet ready, and the others all torment
      him the more. Mozart has connected this quartet with the overture, which
      leads into the first scene without a break. We have a merry flourish of
      trumpets and drums, taken up by the whole orchestra, and at once we are in
      the midst of wedding festivities and joyous excitement. The plan of the
      <span class="side">LO SPOSO DELUSO, 1784.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p061.png">[61]</a></span> overture, though without any
      actual allusion, reminds us of that to "Figaro," but falls short of it in
      spirit and refinement. The merriment is interrupted by a tender andante
      3-8, in which strings and wind instruments alternate, prefiguring the
      amorous emotions which are to have a place in the drama. The flourish is
      heard again, the curtain rises, and the andante is repeated in its main
      points, the instrumental movement serving as a foundation for the free
      motion of the voices. The different points are more sharply accented, and
      the hearer's enjoyment is intensified by the richer and more brilliant
      working out of the movement, which shows itself, as it were, in an
      altogether new light. The ensemble is inspired with cheerful humour, full
      of dramatic life, and showing distinctly Mozart's own art of giving
      independence and freedom to the voices and orchestra, as members of one
      perfect whole. The draft is worked out somewhat beyond the first design,
      the stringed instruments being almost written in full, and the principal
      entrances of the wind instruments at least indicated. We are thus enabled
      to form a sufficient idea of the movement, which, had it been completed,
      would have been so brilliant an introduction to the opera. Two airs are
      preserved in the customary sketch form&mdash;voices and bass entire, and
      detached indications for the violin. In the soprano air (3), however, the
      outline is so characteristic that but a small effort of imagination
      suffices to endow it with the effect of full instrumentation. The
      caricatured haughtiness of the Roman lady Eugenia is shown in the very
      first words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between pomposity and volubility is given at once; the object
      is to balance one with the other, so that they may appear natural displays
      of a consistent character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moderation of tone thus obtained is all the more necessary from the
      character being a female one, since a woman cannot be caricatured to the
      point of being revolting, as a man can, without injury to the comic
      effect.

    </p>
    <p>
      Caricature, which emphasises certain characteristic features of an
      individual at the cost of others less striking must always be an
      objectionable mode of musical representation. The external features which
      can be exaggerated by the musician are limited and soon exhausted, the
      exaggeration of emotional expression to produce a comic effect is a very
      dangerous device, because music does not possess the resources which
      enable poetry and the formative arts to represent disproportions of
      caricature as amusing and comical rather than distorted and hideous.
      Mozart takes as the foundation for his musical representation a genuine
      pride, which is only led by chance impulses to express itself in an
      exaggerated and distorted manner, and it is this temporary
      self-contradiction which produces the comic effect. The musical device he
      employs for the purpose is the composition of the air in the traditional
      heroic form of opera seria, which is opposed to the situation of the
      moment as well as to the fault-finding words. The compass and employment
      of the voice show that Mozart had Storace in view, for whom he afterwards
      composed Susanna. Pulcherio's second air (4) is much more sketchily
      delineated. Eugenia and Bocconio, after their first meeting, are not on
      very good terms with each other, and the obliging friend seeks to
      reconcile them; he draws Bocconio's attention to Eugenia's beauty, and
      hers to Bocconio's amiability, and as he goes first to one and then to the
      other with his appeals, he pictures to himself the misery which is sure to
      follow the union of the two. The contrasting motifs to which the situation
      gives rise are arranged in animated alternation. The sketch, however,
      shows only the general design; and the share taken in it by the orchestra,
      doubtless a very important one, cannot be even approximately arrived at. A
      terzet (5 cf., Vol. II., p. 424) between Eugenia, Don Asdrubale and
      Bocconio is completely worked out, and causes regret that it was not
      inserted in a later opera, that so we might have heard it from the stage.
      Don Asdrubale coming to greet Bocconio's bride, the lovers in amazement
      recognise each other. Eugenia, who had been informed of Don Asdrubale's
      death in battle, falls half-swooning on a couch, and Bocconio hastens off
      to fetch <span class="side">LO SPOSO DELUSO, 1784.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p063.png">[63]</a></span> restoratives.
      Asdrubale, who is on the way to Rome that he may wed Eugenia, overwhelms
      her with reproaches, and throws himself on a couch in despair. Eugenia has
      risen, and before Asdrubale can explain himself, Bocconio returns, and to
      his astonishment finds the scene completely altered. At this point the
      terzet begins, and expresses most charmingly the confusion and
      embarrassment of the three personages, who are all in the dark as to each
      other's conduct, and who put restraint on themselves even in their
      extremity of suspense. The orchestra carries on the threads independently,
      joined by the voices, sometimes apart and interrupted, to suit the
      situation, sometimes together. An excellent effect is given by the sharply
      accented expression of involuntary painful emotion contrasting with the
      reserve which otherwise prevails in the terzet. The whole tone of the
      piece is masterly; while never overstepping the limits of comic opera, it
      successfully renders the deep agitation of mind of all the three
      characters. This is contrived, not by the mixture of a comic element in
      the person of Bocconio, who rather approximates to the frame of mind of
      the other two, but by the cheerful tone which penetrates the whole without
      any loss of truth of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opera again stopped short of completion, and a third seems to have
      had the same fate. A terzet for male voices, which is preserved in
      duplicate draft, was intended for the first scene of a comic opera. An
      opera by Accoromboni, "Il Regno delle Amazoni," was, according to Fétis,
      performed at Parma in 1782, as well as elsewhere,<a href="#linknote35-31"
      name="linknoteref35-31" id="linknoteref35-31"> 31 </a> with success, and
      the words of the terzet leave little doubt that this, too, was among the
      "little books" Mozart had looked through, and that it suggested to him an
      experiment which must almost have coincided in point of time with the two
      just mentioned. It can scarcely have been the imperfections of the
      libretti alone which caused Mozart to leave these operas unfinished, but
      also the improbability of ever bringing them to performance. The brilliant
      reception accorded to the Italian maestri, Sarti and Paesiello, in Vienna,
      only caused <span class="side">MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p064.png">[64]</a></span> the German
      masters to fall more into the background. The extraordinary success of
      Paesiello and Casti with "Il Re Teodoro'' (Vol. II., p. 344), alarmed even
      Salieri. He had himself begun an opera, "Il Ricco d' un Giorno," but laid
      it aside rather than enter into competition with the "Re Teodoro." He was
      always skilful in turning circumstances to account. When his
      "Rauchfangkehrer" failed in 1781, and Mozart's "Entführung" was rousing
      great expectations, he received in the nick of time a commission from
      Munich to write the opera "Semiramide," which was performed during the
      Carnival.<a href="#linknote35-32" name="linknoteref35-32"
      id="linknoteref35-32"> 32 </a> He then set out, recommended and patronised
      by Gluck, to produce "Les Danaides" in Paris. Crowned with new laurels, by
      reason of the success which it there met with, he returned to Vienna and
      completed his opera, after the first enthusiasm for his rivals had died
      out. It was given on December 6, 1784, but without success.<a
      href="#linknote35-33" name="linknoteref35-33" id="linknoteref35-33"> 33
      </a> Mozart's prospects for the year 1785 were not any more favourable,
      when suddenly help appeared from an unexpected quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lorenzo da Ponte (1749-1838),<a href="#linknote35-34"
      name="linknoteref35-34" id="linknoteref35-34"> 34 </a> a native of Ceneda,
      was exiled from the republic of Venice, where he had been schoolmaster, on
      account of his opinions and manner of life. After a short stay in Gorz and
      Dresden, he came to Vienna, warmly recommended to Salieri by the poet
      Mazzola, just as the Italian opera was in process of being established.
      Through Salieri's influence he was appointed a theatrical poet by Joseph
      II., who continued to befriend him; he had thus every reason to be
      beholden to Salieri. His first attempt was this opera, "Il Ricco d' un
      Giorno," which he did not himself consider a success; Salieri ascribed its
      failure, which he felt the more keenly in contrast to Paesiello's success,
      solely and entirely to the poet, and swore that he would sooner cut off
      his hand than set to music another word of Da Ponte's. He had no
      difficulty in obtaining a libretto <span class="side">CASTI&mdash;DA
      PONTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p065.png">[65]</a></span>
      from Casti, "La Grotta di Trofonio"; and this opera, which was first given
      on October 12, 1785, was a great success.<a href="#linknote35-35"
      name="linknoteref35-35" id="linknoteref35-35"> 35 </a> Da Ponte now saw
      himself threatened in his position, for Casti was his declared rival and
      opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casti had long been famous as a witty and gallant verse-maker; he was
      acquainted with the most influential men of the day, and was ambitious of
      succeeding Metastasio as <i>poeta Cesareo</i>. The rise of Da Ponte, who
      had to some extent taken Metastasio's place in the theatre, would be
      altogether against his interests; he sought therefore both by praise and
      blame to bring his rival into discredit, and ridiculed him personally in
      his operetta, "Prima la Musica" (Vol. III., p. 47). Casti carried his
      vanity and self-complacency to such a pitch that Kelly mimicked him on the
      stage in his own opera ("Demo-gorgone"), to the intense delight of the
      public.<a href="#linknote35-36" name="linknoteref35-36"
      id="linknoteref35-36"> 36 </a> It was plainly Da Ponte's interest to gain
      the favour of composers who might do credit to his operatic libretti.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vincent Martin (1754-1810), born in Valencia, and therefore called "Lo
      Spagnuolo," had produced some operas in Italy with success since 1781;
      Storace had made a furore in one of them at Venice.<a href="#linknote35-37"
      name="linknoteref35-37" id="linknoteref35-37"> 37 </a> This caused him to
      repair to Vienna in 1784, where the wife of the Spanish Ambassador took
      him under her powerful protection. At the command of the Emperor Da Ponte
      adapted for him the opera, "Il Burbero di Buon Core," after Goldoni's
      comedy, which was performed for the first time on January 4, 1786, with
      complete success; but his next operas, "Il Finto Cieco," composed by
      Gazzaniga, and "Il Demogorgone," composed by Righini, were not
      particularly successful. Not satisfied with these composers, he cast his
      eyes on Mozart, to whom he had promised a libretto as early as 1783. Da
      Ponte positively affirms<a href="#linknote35-38" name="linknoteref35-38"
      id="linknoteref35-38"> 38 </a> that it was owing to his readiness and
      decision that Mozart was enabled to place his masterpiece on the stage in
      defiance of all the cabals and intrigues of his enemies; and he expresses
      the <span class="side">MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p066.png">[66]</a></span> hope that an
      impartial and truthful account of the affair will make this evident. We
      shall therefore follow his account, but shall correct and modify it in its
      details by means of other available information.<a href="#linknote35-39"

    <p>
      Baron Wezlar, a great lover of music, in whose house Mozart had lived for
      a time (Vol. II., p. 304), had brought about the acquaintance between the
      latter and Da Ponte, and proved himself a munificent patron on the
      occasion. On Mozart's expressing anxiety lest an opera composed by him
      should not be allowed to appear, Wezlar engaged to pay the librettist a
      suitable fee, and to bring about the performance of the opera in London or
      Paris if the obstacles in Vienna proved insurmountable. Confiding in the
      favour and discernment of the Emperor, Da Ponte declined this offer. In
      discussing a suitable subject Mozart expressed the wish that Da Ponte
      would adapt Beaumarchais' comedy, "Le Mariage de Figaro," which, after a
      prolonged struggle, had been given for the first time on April 27, 1784,
      and was now occupying public attention. The adaptation would be an easy
      matter, but the Emperor had forbidden the production of the piece at the
      National Theatre on account of its freedom of tone. Da Ponte, however,
      hoped to overcome this difficulty; he agreed with Mozart to keep.the
      undertaking a secret. They set to work, Da Ponte writing the libretto, and
      Mozart composing it gradually as he received it: <i>in six weeks the whole
      was finished</i>. Fortunately there was a dearth of new operas at the
      time. Da Ponte, without consulting any one, went straight to the Emperor,
      and told him what had happened. The Emperor had misgivings both as to
      Mozart, who, though an excellent instrumental composer, had written an
      opera which was no great success ("non era gran cosa"), and as to the
      piece which he had already suppressed. Da Ponte declared that he would be
      answerable for Mozart as well as for the piece, which he had adapted in
      such a manner as to be perfectly fit for representation. The Emperor gave
      way, summoned Mozart before him with the score, and after <span
      class="side">ADAPTATION OF "FIGARO," 1785.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p067.png">[67]</a></span> hearing some portions of it,
      commanded that it should be performed and put into rehearsal at once. This
      caused much displeasure to Mozart's opponents, Casti and Count Rosenberg,
      "a sworn enemy of the Germans, who would listen to nothing that was not
      Italian,"<a href="#linknote35-40" name="linknoteref35-40"
      id="linknoteref35-40"> 40 </a> and who made as many difficulties as he
      could. Da Ponte relates one instance of the kind. The manager, Bussani
      (the singer who was cast for the part of Bartolo), told Count Rosenberg
      that in the third act of "Figaro," during the wedding festivities, while
      Susanna is conveying the letter to the Count, a ballet was to be
      introduced. Rosenberg sent for the poet, reminded him that the Emperor
      would not allow a ballet, and turning a deaf ear to his remonstrances,
      tore the scene out of the book. Mozart was furious; wanted to call the
      Count to answer, to horsewhip Bussani, to appeal to the Emperor, to take
      back the score&mdash;in short, he could with difficulty be pacified. At
      the full rehearsal the Emperor was present. In obedience to Rosenberg's
      order the ballet was omitted, and in dead silence Susanna and the Count
      made their now meaningless gestures. The Emperor, in amazement, asked what
      it all meant, and on Da Ponte's explanation of the affair, ordered a
      proper ballet to be at once arranged. This story, although Da Ponte may
      have exaggerated the importance of his own share in it, doubtless gives a
      fair idea on the whole of the circumstances under which Mozart's "Figaro"
      was produced. Kelly's assertion that Mozart was commissioned by the
      Emperor to write an opera, and selected "Figaro," accords very well with
      Da Ponte's account. Mozart began his work in the autumn of 1785, as we
      learn from a letter of his father's to Marianne (November 11, 1785):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after six weeks' silence, I have received a letter from your
      brother of November 2, containing quite twelve lines. His excuse for not
      writing is that he has been over head and ears at work on his opera,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Le Nozze di Figaro." He has put off all his pupils to the afternoon, so
      that he may have his mornings free. I have no fear as to the music; <span
      class="side">MOZART AS AN OPERA COMPOSER.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p068.png">[68]</a></span> but there will no doubt be much
      discussion and annoyance before he can get the libretto arranged to his
      wish; and having procrastinated and let the time slip after his usual
      fashion, he is obliged now to set to work in earnest, because Count
      Rosenberg insists upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This contradicts Da Ponte's account of the secrecy with which the opera
      was prepared; and it may be doubted also whether it was really written in
      six weeks. The date in Mozarts own catalogue,-April 29, 1786, only proves
      that he closed his work by writing the overture immediately before the
      first performance (May 1).<a href="#linknote35-41" name="linknoteref35-41"
      id="linknoteref35-41"> 41 </a> Da Ponte may have exaggerated somewhat tor
      the sake of effect. Mozart's Thematic Catalogue shows what he was capable
      of accomplishing even while at work upon "Figaro." There is a hiatus in
      the catalogue from July 5, 1785, to November 5. It is possible that he was
      busy with the opera during this interval; but during the time immediately
      following, when he was working at it in real earnest, we find the
      following compositions entered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1785. November 5. Quartet to the "Villanella Rapita" (Vol. II., p. 331).

    </p>
    <p>
      April 29. "Le Nozze di Figaro" (492 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      To these may be added the Lent Concerts, which were also then occupying
      him. There were other difficulties to be overcome before the performance,
      of which we hear nothing from Da Ponte, but which are related by Kelly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three operas now on the <i>tapis</i>, one by Righini ("ü
      Demo-gorgone"), another by Salieri ("La Grotta di Trofonio"), and one
      <span class="side">INTRIGUES AGAINST "FIGARO."</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p069.png">[69]</a></span> by Mozart, by special command of
      the Emperor. Mozart chose to have Beaumarchais' French comedy, "Le Mariage
      de Figaro," made into an Italian opera, which was done with great ability
      by Da Ponte. These three pieces were nearly ready for representation at
      the same time, and each composer claimed the right of producing his opera
      for the first. The contest raised much discord, and parties were formed.
      The characters of the three men were all very different. Mozart was as
      touchy as gunpowder, and swore that he would put the score of his opera
      into the fire if it was not produced first; his claim was backed by a
      strong party. Righini, on the contrary, was working like a mole in the
      dark to get precedence. The third candidate was Maestro di Capella to the
      court, a clever, shrewd man, possessed of what Bacon called "crooked
      wisdom"; and his claims were backed by three of the principal performers,
      who formed a cabal not easily put down. Every one of the opera company
      took part in the contest. I alone was a stickler for Mozart, and naturally
      enough, for he had a claim on my warmest wishes, from my adoration of his
      powerful genius and the debt of gratitude I owed him for many personal
      favours. The mighty contest was put an end to by his majesty issuing a
      mandate for Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro" to be instantly put into rehearsal.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight error has crept in here, for Salieri's opera was given first on
      October 12, 1785; but this account confirms the fact of the Emperor's
      interference. Mozart's claims were supported by the distinguished company
      of amateurs who arranged a representation of "Idomeneo" at the Auersperg
      Theatre in March (Vol. II., p. 289). The fact that his friends Count
      Hatzfeld (Vol. II., p. 291) and Bridi (Vol. II., p. 359) took his part in
      the dispute shows that it was intended to put Mozart forward as a composer
      of Italian operas, and that powerful support was considered necessary for
      the purpose. His father had cause therefore to write to his daughter
      (April 18):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th, "Le Nozze di Figaro" is to be put on the stage for the first
      time. It will mean much if it succeeds, for I know that there has been a
      surprisingly strong cabal against it. Salieri and all his adherents will
      move heaven and earth against it. Duschek told me lately<a
      href="#linknote35-42" name="linknoteref35-42" id="linknoteref35-42"> 42
      </a> that my son met with such violent opposition because of his
      extraordinary talent and cleverness.

      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p070.png">[70]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Niemetschek (p. 37) goes so far as to assert that it was commonly reported
      that the Italian singers did all they could to ruin the opera on its first
      performance by intentional mistakes and carelessness, and that they had to
      be sternly reminded of their duty by the Emperor, to whom Mozart appealed
      in despair at the end of the first act. Kelly says nothing of this; he
      maintains, on the contrary, that never was opera so strongly cast, and
      that all the subsequent performances he had seen were no more to be
      compared to the original one than light is to darkness:<a

    <p>
      All the original performers had the advantage of the instruction of the
      composer, who transfused into their minds his inspired meaning. I never
      shall forget his little animated countenance, when lighted up with the
      glowing rays of genius; it is as impossible to describe it as it would be
      to paint sunbeams. I remember at the first rehearsal of the full band
      Mozart was on the stage with his crimson pelisse and gold-laced cocked
      hat, giving the time of the music to the orchestra. Figaro's song "Non più
      andrai" Benucci gave with the greatest animation and power of voice. I was
      standing close to Mozart, who, (<i>sotto voce</i>), was repeating: "Bravo!
      bravo, Benucci!" and when Benucci came to the fine passage, "Cherubino,
      alla vittoria, alia gloria militar!" which he gave out with stentorian
      lungs, the effect was electricity itself, for the whole of the performers
      on the stage, and those in the orchestra, as if actuated by one feeling of
      delight, vociferated: "Bravo! bravo, maestro! viva, viva, grande Mozart!"
      Those in the orchestra I thought would never have ceased applauding, by
      beating the bows of their violins against the music-desks. The little man
      acknowledged by repeated obeisances his thanks for the distinguished mark
      of enthusiastic applause bestowed upon him.

      The following was the cast of the first performance, according to Mozart's

      The reception of the opera by the public on its first performance (May 1,
      1786) was such as to justify the most favourable anticipations.<a
      href="#linknote35-45" name="linknoteref35-45" id="linknoteref35-45"> 45
      </a> "Never was anything more complete," says Kelly, "than the triumph of
      Mozart and his 'Nozze di Figaro.'" The house was crowded, and many pieces
      were encored, so that the opera lasted twice the usual time; but that did
      not prevent long-continued applause and repeated calls for Mozart at the
      close of the performance. L. Mozart wrote to his daughter on May 18: "At
      the second performance of your brother's opera (May 3) five pieces were
      encored, and on the third (May 8) seven; one little duet had to be sung
      three times."<a href="#linknote35-46" name="linknoteref35-46"
      id="linknoteref35-46"> 46 </a> The opera, therefore, was a decided
      success; too much so, indeed, for many people, and the Emperor was
      persuaded, after the first performance, to forbid any piece to be encored,
      under the pretence of sparing the singers and the conductor. Kelly
      narrates how the Emperor, after issuing this prohibition, addressing
      himself at a rehearsal to Storace, Mandini, and Benucci, said:<a
      href="#linknote35-47" name="linknoteref35-47" id="linknoteref35-47"> 47
      </a> "I <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p072.png">[72]</a></span> dare say you are all pleased that
      I put a stop to encores; it must be fatiguing and distressing to you to
      repeat so many songs." Storace replied: "It is indeed, sire, very
      distressing." The other two bowed, as if in assent; but Kelly, who was
      standing by, said boldly to the Emperor: "Do not believe them, sire, they
      all like to be encored; at least I am sure I always do"; whereupon the
      Emperor laughed. Mozart's enemies found it impossible to drive the opera
      completely from the stage, but they took care that it should not be given
      often enough to take firm hold of the public favour. Nevertheless, it
      reached nine performances within the year, though with long intervals
      between them (May 1, 3, 8, 24, July 4, August 28, September 22, November
      15, December 18). On November 17 Martin's "Cosa Rara" (after so strong an
      opposition on the part of the singers, that the Emperor was obliged to
      compel them to sing)<a href="#linknote35-48" name="linknoteref35-48"
      id="linknoteref35-48"> 48 </a> achieved an unprecedented success. This
      threw "Figaro" somewhat into the shade, both in the public estimation and
      in the Emperor's opinion; the latter told Dittersdorf that Mozart
      overweighted the singers with his full accompaniments;<a
      href="#linknote35-49" name="linknoteref35-49" id="linknoteref35-49"> 49
      </a> Martin's easy and taking melodies were far more to the royal taste.
      During 1787 and 1788 "Figaro" was not given at all in Vienna,<a
      href="#linknote35-50" name="linknoteref35-50" id="linknoteref35-50"> 50
      </a> and was not reproduced until August 29, 1789.

      THE choice of Beaumarchais' comedy "Le Mariage de Figaro, ou La Folle
      Journée," as a subject for operatic treatment, was deliberately made by
      Mozart himself.<a href="#linknote36-1" name="linknoteref36-1"
      id="linknoteref36-1"> 1 </a> The <span class="side">LE MARIAGE DE FIGARO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p073.png">[73]</a></span> play had
      excited unusual interest, both on account of the name and political
      position of the author and of the curious circumstances under which it had
      been produced in Paris. Beaumarchais had offered his comedy, towards the
      end of 1781, to the Théätre-Français, where it was readily accepted. But
      rumours prejudicial to the piece led Louis XVI. to have it read aloud in
      his presence; he was horrified at its freedom of tone, and declared that
      he would never consent to its performance. This only served to stimulate
      curiosity, and people thronged to hear the reading of the manuscript; a
      strong court party interested themselves for its production, the actors
      pressed for it, the public insisted upon it. Beaumarchais knew well how to
      turn all these circumstances to account; in June, 1783, his comedy was on
      the point of performance at the court theatre; the audience was actually
      assembled, when, just as the curtain was about to rise, a fresh
      prohibition arrived, from the King. Complaints of tyranny and oppression
      now became audible, and the affair assumed a political aspect. At length
      the King was prevailed upon to countenance a private representation at a
      festival given by M. de Vaudreuil to the Comte d'Artois in September,
      1783. Beaumarchais contrived that this should lead to a public
      performance, which took place in April, 1784.<a href="#linknote36-2"
      name="linknoteref36-2" id="linknoteref36-2"> 2 </a> The unheard-of success
      of the play caused its reputation to spread rapidly, and Mozart's
      attention could not fail to be attracted to it, the more so as Paesiello's
      "Barbiere di Seviglia," founded on Beaumarchais' earlier comedy, had been
      well received in Vienna. Mozart's search for a suitable libretto among the
      Italian ones already published, and his attempt to produce a new one with.
      Varesco, were equally unsuccessful. The accepted form of opera buffa,
      relying for effect solely on broadly comic situations and caricature, did
      not satisfy Mozart's conditions of dramatic reality in the development of
      an interesting plot and a consistent delineation of character. Both
      conditions were amply fulfilled by Beaumarchais. "Le Nozze di Figaro" is
      well known to be in a certain sort a continuation of the "Barbiere di
      Seviglia."

      The majority of the characters appear in both pieces, events belonging to
      the plot of "Figaro" are grounded on the previous play, and it is
      necessary for a proper appreciation of the motives and characterisation to
      bear the connection of the two in mind:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Almaviva having, with Figaro's help, gained the hand of Rosina, the
      charming ward of Doctor Bartolo, takes Figaro and Marcellina, Rosina's
      duenna, into his service, and retires to his castle, attended also by
      Basilio, the music-master. He soon wearies of his wife's society, and
      seeks distraction in the company of Susanna, the Countess's maid and
      Figaro's affianced bride. Basilio is again made to act the part of a
      go-between. The piece begins on the day appointed for Figaro's wedding.
      Figaro, having learnt the Count's designs from Susanna, determines to
      outwit his master, and to prevent the success of his scheme for delaying
      the wedding. In this scheme the Count is offered assistance by Marcellina,
      who is in love with Figaro, and possesses his written undertaking to marry
      her should he fail in repaying her by a certain day a sum of money she has
      lent him. Her dread of losing all chance of Figaro, by his union with
      Susanna, induces her to call Bartolo to her assistance, and the latter is
      the more ready to do what he can, both that he may revenge himself on
      Figaro, and free himself from Marcellina's claims upon him. It appears
      that years ago she bore him a son, who was kidnapped as a child. While
      this danger is hanging over the heads of the lovers, Susanna is sought in
      her room by the page Cherubino, a heedless and beautiful youth, just
      budding into manhood. The Count has surprised him with Fanchette, daughter
      of his gardener Antonio, with whom he is himself flirting, and has
      discharged him from his service; he begs Susanna to intercede for him with
      the Countess, his godmother, for whom he entertains an ardent passion. As
      they converse, they hear the Count approaching, and Cherubino hides behind
      a large arm-chair; the Count has come to offer Susanna a dowry if she will
      consent to meet him the same evening; she, however, vigorously repulses
      him. Basilio enters: the Count hides behind the same arm-chair, and
      Cherubino slips round to the front, and covers himself with a cloak which
      lies upon the chair. Basilio reiterates to Susanna the Count's proposals,
      and, on her continued refusal, makes malicious allusions to the page, who
      is paying court not only to Susanna, but to the Countess. The Count comes
      forward in a fury, orders the immediate dismissal of the page, tells how
      he found him concealed in the gardener's house, and discovers him in the
      arm-chair. But Cherubino has been a witness to all that has passed, and,
      in order to conciliate and get rid of him at the same time, the Count
      gives him a commission in his regiment, ordering his immediate departure
      for Seville, to join the garrison there. At this point Figaro enters at
      the head of the villagers in holiday attire. The Count, at his marriage,
      had <span class="side">BEAUMARCHAIS' FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p075.png">[75]</a></span> renounced his seignorial rights,
      and, instigated by Figaro, his grateful subjects come to petition him to
      honour the first wedding which has since been celebrated by himself
      placing the wreath on the head of the bride. The Count cannot refuse the
      petition, but begs for a few hours delay, in order that the ceremony may
      be rendered more brilliant. Figaro in the meantime is plotting a double
      intrigue against the Count, with the co-operation of the Countess, who has
      been kept informed of all that is going on by her devoted Susanna. Her
      relations to Figaro and Susanna, and her ready acquiescence in a design to
      recall her husband to a sense of his duty by means of a trick, keep us in
      mind that the Countess Almaviva is the Rosina of the "Barber of Seville."
      She loves her husband, and has a full consciousness of her own dignity;
      but the circumstances of her early life, and of her marriage with Count
      Almaviva, have left their indelible impress upon her. Figaro warns the
      Count, who has gone hunting, by an anonymous letter that a rival has made
      an assignation with the Countess; he hopes that jealousy will divert his
      mind from the wedding. On the other side he assures him of Susanna's
      intention to keep her appointment in the garden; Cherubino, who has been
      allowed to delay his departure at Figaro's intercession, is to be
      disguised so as to take Susanna's place at the interview. |The page comes
      to be dressed; all at once the Count knocks, having hurried home in
      jealous haste. Cherubino slips into the inner room, of which the Countess
      locks the door; as the Count is plying her with angry questions Cherubino
      throws down a chair; the Countess explains that Susanna is within, but
      refuses to allow her to come out, or even to answer, and will not give up
      the key. The Count, enraged, secures all means of egress, and drags the
      Countess away with him to fetch an axe and break the door open. Susanna,
      who has been concealed in an alcove during this scene, proceeds to
      liberate Cherubino; he, finding no other exit available, springs through
      the window into the garden, and Susanna takes his place in the cabinet.
      The Count returning with the Countess, determined to employ force in
      opening the door, she confesses that the page is in the inner chamber,
      whereby his rage is still further excited; to the astonishment of them
      both Susanna steps forth. The Countess soon collects herself, and explains
      that their only intention has been to punish him for his want of faith,
      and that Figaro wrote the letter as a preliminary to the trick; the Count
      is forced to sue for pardon, which he obtains with difficulty. Figaro now
      enters with the information that all is prepared for the wedding, and
      being taxed by the Count with the letter, denies all knowledge of it, and
      is with difficulty brought to understand the position of affairs. This
      danger is hardly over when the gardener enters, half tipsy, with the
      complaint that some one has just jumped from the window of the cabinet
      upon his flowers; Figaro declares that he was there with Susanna, and had
      jumped into the garden from fear of the Count's fury. The gardener says
      that he thought he had recognised Cherubino, but hands Figaro a paper
      which <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p076.png">[76]</a></span> had been dropped in the garden.
      The Count, his suspicions newly awakened, demands the contents of the
      paper; the Countess recognises in it the page's patent, and whispers
      through Susanna to Figaro, who is able to ward off this fresh danger.
      Marcellina now appears supported by Bartolo, and makes known Figaro's
      promise of marriage; the Count, in high delight, promises to support her
      claims in a court of justice, and by dismissing Basilio, who puts forward
      his claims to Marcellina's hand, revenges himself for the letter which
      Basilio had presented to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the sitting of the court the Countess conceives the design of
      herself taking Susanna's place at the rendezvous with the Count. The trial
      which takes place results in Figaro's being ordered to pay his debt to
      Marcellina, or in default to marry her. The Count appears at the goal of
      his wishes, but Figaro's evasion&mdash;that he must have the consent of
      his parents&mdash;leads to the discovery that he is the long-lost son of
      Bartolo and Marcellina, who thereupon decide to celebrate their espousals
      together with his; Susanna, entering with money obtained from the Countess
      to redeem Figaro, is indignant at finding him in Marcellina's arms, but
      her anger is speedily turned to delight at hearing the true position of
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the solemn wedding ceremony&mdash;at which Cherubino, disguised as
      Fanchette, appears among the village maidens and is recognised&mdash;Susanna
      gives the Count a letter dictated by the Countess, in which she appoints
      the place of rendezvous; a pin which is stuck into the letter is to be
      returned as a token of understanding. Figaro sees that the Count reads the
      letter and pricks himself with the pin, without noticing that Susanna has
      given it to him; hearing afterwards from Fanchette that she is
      commissioned by the Count to convey the pin back to Susanna, he easily
      surmises what it means. Beside himself with jealousy, he stations his
      parents and friends in the neighbourhood of the appointed place, and
      repairs thither himself to surprise and punish the guilty pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness of night the Countess and Susanna, having exchanged
      clothes, come to put their husbands to the proof; Susanna has been warned
      by Marcellina of Figaro's designs. Scarcely is the Countess alone, when
      she is alarmed by the approach of Cherubino, who presses a kiss on the
      supposed Susanna; the Count, entering on the instant, salutes the page
      with a box on the ear, which is received instead by the listening Figaro.
      Alone with the Countess, the Count addresses her in the most endearing
      terms, presents her with money, and with a costly ring, and endeavours to
      go off with her; she escapes him in the darkness, and he seeks her in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Susanna, as the Countess, comes to the enraged Figaro, but
      forgetting for a moment to disguise her voice, he recognises her, and
      turns the tables by proposing to her to revenge herself for her lord's
      want of faith by her own, whereupon she makes herself known by <span
      class="side">DA PONTE'S LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p077.png">[77]</a></span> boxing his ears. Peace is easily
      restored by his explanation, and as the Count approaches, seeking his
      Susanna, they continue to counterfeit love. The Count in a rage calls for
      his people with torches, Figaro's friends hasten in, and with them the
      Countess. The Count, to his shame, discovers that it was his wife who
      accepted his presents and declarations of love, and the pardon which she
      accords to him brings the confusion to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is a mere outline of this amusing play of intrigue, where one knot
      twisting in with another, one embarrassment growing out of another, call
      forth ever and again fresh contrivances, while an abundance of effective
      situations and characteristic detail make the witty and satirical dialogue
      one of the most graphic character pictures of the time.<a
      href="#linknote36-3" name="linknoteref36-3" id="linknoteref36-3"> 3 </a>
      Da Ponte has arranged his libretto with much skill, having no doubt
      received important aid from Mozart himself. The progress of the piece is
      left almost unaltered, the necessary abbreviations being judiciously made.<a
      href="#linknote36-4" name="linknoteref36-4" id="linknoteref36-4"> 4 </a>
      Thus, the lengthy trial scene is omitted, and only the result in its
      bearing on the plot is communicated. Sometimes an under-plot is added,
      such as Basilio's appearance as Marcellina's lover. The clearness of the
      plot is not often endangered, as it certainly is by the alteration which
      omits all mention of a son of Bartolo and Marcellina previous to their
      recognition of Figaro as their offspring. The musical pieces are
      introduced with admirable discrimination in such positions as to allow
      free and natural scope to the musical rendering of each situation without
      hindering the progress of the plot, and this is no small praise in such a
      piece as "Figaro." The whole scheme of the drama demands that quite as
      much attention shall be given to the ensemble movements and finales as
      <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p078.png">[78]</a></span> the solo airs; and this is of
      great advantage to the musical construction. The definite and prearranged
      progress of the action fulfils all the conditions of operatic
      representation with regard to the position and diversity of the musical
      pieces; the poetical conceptions are clever and appropriate, a suggestion
      of Beaumarchais being often amplified in the musical working-out. The
      French comedy was of wonderful advantage in maintaining the dialogue; and,
      shortened and modified as it was of necessity, it retained far more of the
      spirit and life of the original than was usual in the recitatives of opera
      buffa. This is not indeed the case as far as the German adaptations of the
      opera are concerned. I am not aware whence proceeded the first translation
      made use of in Berlin in 1790.<a href="#linknote36-5"
      name="linknoteref36-5" id="linknoteref36-5"> 5 </a> In 1791 Knigge adapted
      the opera for Schroder in Hamburg;<a href="#linknote36-6"
      name="linknoteref36-6" id="linknoteref36-6"> 6 </a> in 1792 it was given
      in Vienna, translated by Gieseke; and in 1794 Vulpius's translation
      appeared. A new translation, giving not only Da Ponte's verses, but
      Mozart's improvements on them, is a pressing necessity. The vast
      superiority of "Le Nozze di Figaro," in characterisation, plot, and
      dialogue, to the very best of opera buffa libretti may be easily discerned
      by comparing it with other famous operas, such as Casti's "Re Teodoro" or
      "Grotta di Trofonio." In many essential points "Figaro" overstepped the
      limits of opera buffa proper, and brought to view entirely new elements of
      dramatic construction. The political element indeed, on which perhaps most
      of the effect of the comedy depended, was altogether omitted from the
      opera. Not only does the dialogue receive its essential character from the
      satire and scorn which it freely casts upon the abuses of political and
      social life&mdash;the whole tendency of the play is to depict the nobleman
      of the period, who, himself without truth and honour, demands both from
      others, indulges his lust without scruple, and thereby causes his
      dependents, injured in their moral rights, to turn against him their
      intellectual superiority, so that he is finally <span class="side">DA
      PONTE'S LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p079.png">[79]</a></span>
      worsted and disgraced. This conception of the nobility and their position
      in relation to the citizen class is expressed with energy and malice, and
      found such a response in the prevailing opinions of the time, that the
      production of the piece against the expressed will of the King appeared to
      be a public confirmation of the principles which inspired it; and Napoleon
      might with justice say of "Figaro": "C'était la révolution déjà en
      action."<a href="#linknote36-7" name="linknoteref36-7" id="linknoteref36-7">
      7 </a> Every trace of these feelings has vanished in the opera, as will be
      clearly perceived by a comparison of the celebrated "Frondeur-monologue"
      of Figaro in the fifth act with the jealous song in the opera. The
      omission was made not so much in deference to the Emperor Joseph's
      scruples as with the right conviction that the political element is
      altogether out of place in music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The omission of political satire is the more serious because it leaves as
      the central point of the plot an immorality which is not exactly
      justified, but not by any means seriously punished; only treated with a
      certain frivolity. The noble libertine is opposed by true and upright
      love, honest devotion to duty and honourable conduct; but these moral
      qualities are not made in themselves effective; the true levers of the
      plot are cunning and intrigue employed as weapons of defence. The whole
      piece appears in a doubtful light, the atmosphere surrounding Count
      Almaviva is impure, and the suppression of those circumstances which could
      alone make the phenomenon natural affects more or less the whole spirit of
      the plot, and deprives the dialogue of much of its point and double
      meaning.

      Beaumarchais might fairly plead that, having undertaken to give a true
      picture of the manners of his time, absolute truth of conception and
      detail was necessary to insure the right moral effect; it was for a later
      age to perceive how completely the author of the satire was himself under
      the influence of the time which he depicts and would fain improve. This
      justification is denied to the opera. It has no title to be considered as
      a picture of morals, neither can it pretend to exercise any direct
      influence, whether moral or <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p080.png">[80]</a></span>
      political, on the minds of men. The dialogue is undoubtedly in many
      respects purer than in the comedy; but the plot and its motives, the chief
      situations, the whole point of view, become all the more decidedly
      frivolous. How came it, then the Mozart could choose such a subject for
      his opera, and that the public could accept it with approbation? It must
      in the first place be borne in mind that the facts on which the plot is
      founded, and the point of view from which these facts are regarded, had at
      that time substantial truth and reality; men were not shocked at seeing on
      the stage that which they had themselves experienced, and knew to be going
      on in their own homes. A later age is disgusted by the contrast between
      semblance and reality, and at the representation of immorality in all its
      nakedness; the taste of the time demands that it shall be shown after
      another form and fashion. A glance at the entertaining literature, and
      even at the operas of the last half of the eighteenth century, shows
      clearly that representation of immorality plays an important part therein
      in a form which bespeaks the temper and spirit of the time; and further,
      that a desire for the representation of moral depravity is an infallible
      symptom of moral disease. It cannot, therefore, be wondered at that a
      picture of the moral corruption which penetrated all classes, from the
      highest to the lowest, and which had brought all social and political
      relations to the verge of dissolution, should have been regarded with
      eager approbation and enjoyment. The age which produced and enjoyed
      "Figaro" took a lighter view of sensual gratification and the moral
      turpitude connected therewith than that which seems right to a generation
      grown serious by reason of higher aims and nobler struggles. It need not
      here be discussed how far manners and opinions which change with the times
      are to be regarded as absolute morality; the point we are proving is
      undeniable, and is apparent, often painfully so, in all the light
      literature and memoirs of the day. Caroline Pichler writes in reference to
      this very period:<a href="#linknote36-8" name="linknoteref36-8"

      There prevailed a taste for all that was beautiful and pleasant in Vienna
      at that time. The mind had freer movement than at present, and anything
      might be written and printed which was not in the strictest sense of the
      word contrary to religion and the state. There was not nearly so much
      stress laid upon <i>good manners</i>. Plays and romances of a tolerably
      free tendency were admitted and discussed in good society. Kotzebue was
      very much thought of. His pieces, as well as Gemmingen's "Deutscher
      Hausvater," Schroder's "Ring," and many others which are sunk in oblivion,
      together with a number of tales and romances (Meissner's sketches above
      all) were founded on indecent subjects. They were read without scruple or
      concealment by all the world, and every young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      I myself saw and read them all repeatedly; "Oberon" I knew well, and
      Meissner's "Alcibiades." No mother felt any scruple at allowing her
      daughter to become acquainted with such works; and indeed living examples
      of what we read moved before us with so little concealment of their
      irregular and immoral doings, that it would not have been possible for any
      mother to keep her daughter in ignorance on these points.

      It is sufficient to refer to the reading of Wieland's works.

      name="linknoteref36-9" id="linknoteref36-9"> 9 </a> There can be no doubt
      that in this respect Mozart was a child of his time; that he willingly
      allowed himself to glide along the pleasant stream of life in Vienna, and
      that his merrier moods were often productive of free and even coarse
      jests. The frivolous element in Beaumarchais' comedy was not, therefore,
      likely to repel him, although it would be unfair to assert that it mainly
      attracted him; he accepted it, as others did, as the sauce which was most
      likely to be of acceptable flavour.

      His chief concern was doubtless the gradual unfolding and continual
      interest of the plot, and the graphic delineation of character, qualities
      which were entirely overlooked by the ordinary opera buffa. Any approach
      to probability or analogy with actual life was not thought of, and was
      <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p082.png">[82]</a></span> not often replaced even by a
      fanciful poetic vein of humour; attempts to give consistency to the
      caricatures of individuals and situations only served to bring their
      irreconcilable contrasts into stronger relief. In "Figaro," on the
      contrary, the interest depends upon, the truth the representation of
      actual life. The motives of the actors are serious, they are carried out
      with energy and intellect, and from them the situations are naturally
      developed; only the light in which they are all portrayed is that of
      Beaumarchais' strongly accented "gaieté," which is by no means innocent,
      and in its essence nothing less than musical. It is one of the strongest
      proofs of Mozart's genius that he should have undertaken, moved as he was
      by the dramatic signification of the piece, to infuse a new soul into it
      by his musical treatment; so sure was he that whatever came home to his
      mind might be used as the germ of a living creation. The musical
      representation, however, could only be a true one by relying entirely on
      the emotions which alone are capable of being expressed in music.<a
      href="#linknote36-10" name="linknoteref36-10" id="linknoteref36-10"> 10
      </a> The whole piece is raised to a higher sphere by the subordination of
      the powers of understanding and intellect, which Beaumarchais had made the
      chief factors in his design. Beaumarchais' aim was to preserve his plot
      and characters from vulgarity or caricature; the point of view whence the
      musical reconstruction proceeded led inevitably to an ennobling of the
      whole representation. In depicting emotions, whether as the impulse to
      action, or as giving significance even to the least commendable promptings
      of the mind, the musician was in his own element, and the <span
      class="side">MUSICAL TREATMENT OF THE DRAMA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p083.png">[83]</a></span> wealth of dramatic situations and
      characters was a pure gain to an artist who knew how to turn it to
      account. The piercing eye of genius finds materials for its finest
      performance where a more superficial view reveals nothing but
      difficulties. If each of the characters, pursuing the interests they have
      at heart, are to express their inner sentiments at every point in
      conformity with their nature, it follows that the aim of dramatic
      characterisation in its true sense must be the representation of
      individuality, sharp and precise in form, true and pure as to its source;
      thus only will the exaggeration of caricature be avoided. This holds good
      of all the chief characters in "Figaro"&mdash;of the Count and Countess,
      Figaro, Susanna, and Cherubino. They are so entirely governed by their
      emotions and passions, so completely involved in the complications
      proceeding therefrom, that an artistic representation must depend on the
      depicting of these emotions in their fullest truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bartolo and Marcellina seem to invite a treatment in caricature. In the
      "Barber of Seville" we find the same Bartolo as a buffo character. This is
      made impossible here by the fact that they are to appear afterwards as
      Figaro's parents, and ought not, therefore, to cut grotesque figures in
      our eyes. Beaumarchais' point, that Marcellina gives herself airs of
      superiority to Susanna, "parce qu'elle a fait quelques études et tourmenté
      la jeunesse de Madame" is not available for musical characterisation, but
      Mozart brings it out skilfully in another way. In the duet (Act I., 5), in
      which Susanna and Marcellina vie with each other in impertinence and
      provocation, the expression is toned down by the actual, disputing being
      left to the orchestra, and the two women are put quite on an equality.
      Susanna prevails over Marcellina only by reason of her youthful grace, and
      the whole appears an outbreak of that jealous susceptibility which is said
      to be an attribute of the female sex. Nobler women would not yield to such
      impulses, but these two belong to no exalted sphere, and give the rein to
      their angry humours. But they never forget themselves so far as to offend
      delicacy, and the general tone is a gay one, Marcellina being shown in no
      way inferior to <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p084.png">[84]</a></span> Susanna.<a
      href="#linknote36-11" name="linknoteref36-11" id="linknoteref36-11"> 11
      </a> Afterwards, when graver matters engage her, when she asserts her
      claims upon Figaro in the first finale, or recognises him as her son in
      the sestet, the musical expression is sustained and full of true feeling.
      A singer who was able to form her conception of the part from these
      touches of character would make of Marcellina something quite different
      from the ordinary old housekeeper, whom we have unhappily been used to see
      and hear, no doubt from a mistaken endeavour to render the illusion that
      Figaro's mother must be an old woman, and sing like an old woman.
      Marcellina's air (Act IV., 2)," on the other hand, does not assist the
      characterisation, and is the only piece in the whole opera which fails of
      its effect. The whole style of it, even to the passages, is old-fashioned,
      like the traditional air for a seconda donna; it appears to have been a
      concession made to the taste of the singer. Basilio, the man of cold
      intellect and malicious cunning, is not a figure which can be made comic
      by caricature. Mich. Kelly (1764-1825), for whom it was written, was an
      Irishman, who had studied in Naples, and was highly successful as a tenor
      in Italy and Vienna; his powers as a mimic fitted him especially for comic
      parts.<a href="#linknote36-12" name="linknoteref36-12"
      id="linknoteref36-12"> 12 </a> Basilio's malice and scorn are expressed in
      the terzet (Act I., 7) with delicacy and character, and, in contrast with
      Susanna's painful excitement and the Count's anger, they give to the piece
      an irony, such as has seldom found expression in music. The point justly
      noted by Ulibicheff (II., p. 45 ) that Basilio, in his attempts to pacify
      the Count after finding the page in the arm-chair, repeats the words: "Ah,
      del paggio quel ch' ho detto era solo un mio sospetto," a fifth higher,
      brings out in a striking degree his character of refined malice. The
      effect is heightened by the use of the same motif by the Count, when he is
      <span class="side">BASILIO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p085.png">[85]</a></span> telling how he found the page
      with Barberina; and it is attained in the simplest manner by the natural
      development of the musical structure. Basilio falls into the background in
      the course of the opera; the comic way in which Beaumarchais makes him
      banished by the Count, and his courtship of
    </p>
    <p>
      Marcellina, would have afforded good operatic situations, but abbreviation
      and simplification were absolutely necessary, and much that was not
      essential had to be sacrificed. The air which is given to Basilio in the
      last act (Act IV., 3) scarcely affords compensation. Da Ponte, deprived of
      Beaumarchais' guidance in this place, makes Basilio illustrate by the
      fable of the asses' skin that those who can flatter and deceive succeed in
      the world. The musical rendering follows the story, the orchestra giving
      the characteristic detail. The expression of ease and self-complacency,
      and above all the incomparable idea, deservedly noticed by Ulibicheff, of
      turning the last sentence of the heartless poltroon: "Onte, pericoli,
      vergogna e morte col cuojo d' asino fuggir si puö," into a sort of parody
      of a triumphal march, give the air a character of its own". Executed with
      humour and delicate mimicry it becomes in fact an epitome of Basilio's
      character, with its utter want of genial qualities. But tone-painting
      occurs only in such touches as those of the storm, the yelping dog, the
      hurried retreat, and never comes to the foreground. This means of effect,
      elsewhere so favourite a device in opera buffa, is always sparingly used
      by Mozart. The "Din din, don, don," in the duet between Susanna and Figaro
      (Act I., 2) can scarcely be called tone-painting any more than it can be
      said to be word-painting; it is hardly more than an interjection, which
      has the advantage in its musical rendering of being incorporated as a
      motif in the structure of the piece. Nor can the term be justly applied to
      the march like tone of Figaro's "Non più andrai" (Act I., 9). Certain
      forms and phrases have developed themselves in music as expressions of
      warlike ideas, and they are employed as a matter of course where these
      ideas occur; Figaro, describing to the page the military life before him,
      has it mirrored as it were by the orchestra. Mozart wisely guards against
      entering <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p086.png">[86]</a></span> upon any
      musical details in the picture, which would have led to a distorted
      tone-painting; he confines himself to the barest and most general
      allusions produced by association of ideas. It is often difficult to
      decide how far the association of ideas contributes to the partly
      involuntary, partly conscious construction of the musical expression. For
      instance in the first duet between Figaro and Susanna (Act I., 1), the
      motif for the bass&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      with the corresponding one for the first violins, goes very well with
      Figaro's measuring of the room, the diminutions expressing clearly enough
      his repeated stretches. It cannot be doubted that the situation has
      suggested the motif, but whether Mozart intended to express the action of
      measurement is far less certain, and any idea of tone-painting is out of
      the question. The subordinate characters of the drunken gardener Antonio
      and the stuttering judge Don Curzio might under other circumstances have
      been made into caricatures in the sense of opera buffa, but they appear in
      situations which have so decided a character of a totally different kind
      that they could not have departed from it without serious injury to that
      harmony of the whole which none knew better than Mozart how to preserve.
      The little cavatina (Act IV., 1)
    </p>
    <p>
      for Barbarina, (Fanchette in Beaumarchais) is very significantly not
      exactly caricatured, but drawn in stronger colours than is elsewhere the
      case. This little maid, in her liking for Cherubino, and with an
      open-hearted candour which makes her a true <i>enfant terrible</i> to the
      Count, is altogether childish, and not only naïve but unformed. It is,
      therefore, natural that she should express her grief for the lost pin, and
      her fear of punishment, like a child; and when we hear her sobbing and
      crying over it we receive the same ludicrous impression which grown-up
      people rarely fail to feel at the sight of a child expressing the sorrow
      of his heart with an energy quite out of proportion to the occasion. The
      fact that the strong accents which Mozart here multiplies to produce the
      effect of the disproportion of childish <span class="side">FIGARO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p087.png">[87]</a></span> ideas
      are afterwards made use of to express real emotion does no injury to the
      truth of his characterisation. In a similar way the expression of
      sentiment is exaggerated when it is represented as feigned; as, for
      instance, the last finale, when Figaro makes love to the supposed
      Countess, whom he has recognised as Susanna, and grows more and more
      vehement in order to excite the Count's jealousy. Here we have a parody of
      the accents of strongest passion (Vol. II., p. 427). How differently does
      the same Figaro express his true feelings! How simple and genuine is the
      expression of his love in the first duet (Act I., 1), when he interrupts
      his measurements to exclaim to his pretty bride, with heartfelt joy: "Si,
      mio core, or è più bello!" and in the last finale, when he puts an end to
      pretence and, in an exalted mood, with the feeling of his newly won,
      safely assured happiness fresh upon him, exclaims: "Pace! pace, mio dolce
      tesoro!" Equally true is Figaro's expression of the jealousy which results
      from his love. At first indeed this feeling is a curiously mingled one.
      Warned by Susanna herself, he has full confidence in her, and feels all
      his intellectual superiority to the Count; he contemplates his situation
      with a humour which is admirably rendered in the celebrated cavatina (Act
      I., 3). Cheerfully as it begins, the expression of superciliousness and
      versatility has a tinge of bitterness and resentment, betraying how nearly
      he is touched by the affair which he affects to treat so lightly.
      Afterwards, when he believes himself deceived, grief and anger are
      strongly expressed in the recitative preceding his air (Act IV., 4). But
      his originality asserts itself even here. The consciousness of what his
      situation has of the ludicrous never forsakes him, and his anger against
      the whole female sex, which he works up more and more, involuntarily
      assumes a comic character. Here we have one of the many points which
      Mozart added to the text.

      giving, opportunity for a corresponding musical treatment of the words. At
      last Mozart makes the horns strike in unexpectedly and finish the phrase
      for him in a manner full of musical fun. As the consciousness grows upon
      Figaro that he is himself the injured party, his signs of grief and pain
      grow stronger and more animated. The blending of warm feeling with the
      involuntarily comic expression of intellectual reaction is psychologically
      true, and in such a character as Figaro's inevitable; it is embodied in
      the music in a form very different to that of an ordinary buffo aria. Not
      less true to nature is Figaro's resigned expression of disappointed love
      further on, when, having the evidence of his own senses that Susanna has
      been unfaithful to him, he ejaculates: "Tutto è tranquillo." But such a
      mood as this could not be a lasting one with Figaro, and changes at once
      upon Susanna's entrance. Benucci, for whom Mozart wrote Figaro, possessed
      an "extremely round, full, fine bass voice." He was considered a
      first-rate actor as well as singer, and had the rare merit of never
      exaggerating.<a href="#linknote36-13" name="linknoteref36-13"
      id="linknoteref36-13"> 13 </a> The individual characterisation is still
      more sharply defined when several personages appear together in similar
      situations. Immediately upon the air where Figaro declares war upon the
      Count (Act I., 3) follows Bartolo's air (Act I., 5) <a
      href="#linknote36-14" name="linknoteref36-14" id="linknoteref36-14"> 14
      </a> in which the latter announces his approaching victory over Figaro. He
      also is altogether in earnest; Figaro has cruelly deceived him, and the
      long-looked-for <span class="side">BARTOLO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p089.png">[89]</a></span> opportunity of vengeance is close
      at hand: "Tutta Sevilla conosce Bartolo, il birbo Figaro vinto sarà." He
      is full of pride and self-consciousness&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    La vendetta è un piacer serbato ai saggi,
    L' obliar l' onte, gl' oltraggi
    E bassezza, è ognor viltà&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      and the air begins with the forcible and impulsive expression of this
      self-consciousness enhanced by rapid instrumentation; Bartolo feels the
      injury done to him, and his obligation in honour to avenge himself, and
      the sincerity of this feeling invests him with a certain amount of
      dignity. But&mdash;his character has none of the elements of true
      greatness; as soon as he begins to descant on the way in which he is to
      outwit Figaro, his grovelling spirit betrays itself; he excites himself
      with his own chatter, and complacently announces his own triumph
      beforehand. Bartolo's dignity is not, however, a parody on his true self;
      the comic element consists in the contrast of the pride which lays claim
      to dignity and the small-mindedness which unwittingly forfeits the claim.
      The German translations lose the chief point of the characterisation.
      Capitally expressed is the original: "coll' astuzia, coll' arguzia, col
      giudizio, col criterio, si potrebbe&mdash;&mdash;" here the orchestra
      takes up the motif of the words "è basezza," as if to edge him on, but
      soon subsides, as he recollects himself: "si potrebbe, si potrebbe"&mdash;suddenly
      interrupted by "il fatto è serio," to which the whole orchestra responds
      with a startling chord; thereupon he resumes with calm self-confidence:
      "ma, credete, si farà," and then launches into the flood of trivialities
      with which he seeks to bolster up his courage.

      with the words (Act III., 2).: "vedrò, mentr' io sospiro, felice un servo

      disappointed but unvanquished passion presses its sting deep into his
      heart, injured pride flares up prepared to give place to no other feeling
      than that of revenge. In the wonderful passage which follows with renewed
      force upon the immediately preceding tones of sharp complaint&mdash;[See
      Page Image] the change from major to minor brouight about by the chromatic
      passage in the middle parts is of inimitable effect.<a
      href="#linknote36-17" name="linknoteref36-17" id="linknoteref36-17"> 17
      </a> We have before us the nobleman, feeling his honour affronted because
      he is not allowed to injure that of his servant, and there is in the
      expression of his revengeful desires and his certainty of victory no tinge
      of Figaro's cunning or Bartolo's meanness; the stream of passion flows
      full and unmingled, and the noble position of the Count gives it a certain
      amount of composure; his weakness excites regret rather than contempt or
      even ridicule. The expression of this air corresponds to the musical
      conception of the Count throughout the opera, in making his feelings of
      injured pride outweigh those of disappointed desire. Pride, jealousy, or
      anger, unjustifiable as they may be in their outbreaks, are always more
      dignified and nobler motives than a love-making whose only foundation is
      licentiousness, and its only excuse frivolity. He gives free play to this
      feeling in <span class="side">THE COUNT.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p091.png">[91]</a></span> the enchanting duet with Susanna
      (Act III., 1); but the situation is rendered endurable to the audience by
      the knowledge that Susanna is playing a part to please the Countess.
      Mozart has given this little duet a title to be placed in the first rank
      of musical works of art by the delicacy with which he has rendered the
      mixture of encouragement and coyness in Susanna's demeanour, her true
      motives being as clear to the audience as is the misunderstanding of the
      Count. The harmonic turns of her evasive answer to his passionate request,
      "Signor, la donna ognora tempo ha di dir si," are masterpieces of musical
      diplomacy. Even the piquant conceit by which she answers his urgent
      questions, "Verrai? non mancherai?" with "si" instead of "no," and <i>vice
      versa</i>, to his great perplexity, has something more than a merely comic
      signification.<a href="#linknote36-18" name="linknoteref36-18"
      id="linknoteref36-18"> 18 </a> It characterises most strikingly the
      security with which she plays with his passion as expressed in these
      eager, flattering requests. Even here, delight at his hard-won victory
      predominates over his sensual impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sensual element of love plays far too great a part in "Figaro,"
      however, to be altogether disregarded in its musical rendering. It would
      be a difficult matter to determine how far and in what way music is
      capable of giving artistic expression to this side of the tender passion;
      but it cannot be disputed that Mozart has in this respect competed
      successfully with the sister arts of painting and poetry. In Susanna's
      so-called garden air (Act IV., 5) her longing for her betrothed is
      expressed with all the tender intensity of purest beauty; but the simple
      notes, cradled as it were in blissful calm, that seem to be breathed forth
      "soft as the balmy breath of eve," glow with a mild warmth that stirs the
      heart to its depth, entrancing the mind, and intoxicating the senses like
      the song of the nightingale. The <i>pizzicato</i> accompaniment of the air
      fitly suggests a serenade. It gives the voice free scope, and the sparely
      introduced wind instruments, as well as the tender passage for the first
      violin towards the close, only serve to give a finer emphasis to the <span
      class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p092.png">[92]</a></span> full body of the voice. The
      impression of longing delight is intensified by the simplicity of the
      harmonies, as if from fear of disturbing by any sudden change the calm
      bliss of the passing moment. But what analysis can penetrate these
      mysteries of creative genius<a href="#linknote36-19"
      name="linknoteref36-19" id="linknoteref36-19"> 19 </a> Mozart was right to
      let the feelings of the loving maiden shine forth in all their depth and
      purity, for Susanna has none but her Figaro in her mind, and the
      sentiments she expresses are her true ones. Figaro in his hiding-place,
      listening and suspecting her of waiting the Count's arrival, throws, a
      cross light on the situation, which, however, only receives its full
      dramatic signification by reason of the truth of Susanna's expression of
      feeling. Susanna, without her sensual charm is inconceivable, and a tinge
      of sensuality is an essential element of her nature; but Mozart has
      transfigured it into a noble purity which may fitly be compared with the
      grandest achievements of Greek sculpture.

      Nancy Storace (1761-1814), "who possessed in a degree unique at that time,

      a singer to whom Mozart was able to intrust the rendering of this mixture
      of sentiment and sensuality. When "Figaro" was reproduced in July, 1789,
      he wrote for Adriana Ferrarese del Bene,<a href="#linknote36-21"

      with the reference to vows and hopes unfulfilled seem better suited to the
      Countess than to Susanna, though the air is clearly indicated for the
      latter. Apparently the song was intended to strengthen Figaro in the
      delusion that it was the Countess he saw before him. The device might
      intensify the situation, but it was a loss to the musical
      characterisation, for the air was not altogether appropriate either to
      Susanna or the Countess. The singer had evidently wished for a grand,
      brilliant air, and Mozart humoured her by composing the air in two broadly
      designed and elaborately executed movements, allied in style to the great
      airs in "Cosi fan Tutte," and in "Titus." The bravura of the voice and
      orchestra is as entirely foreign to "Figaro" as is the greater display of
      sensual vigour with which the longing for the beloved one is expressed.
      Apart from its individual characterisation, the air has wonderful effects
      of sound and expression, greatly heightened by the orchestra.
      Basset-horns, bassoons, and horns are employed, occasionally <i>concertante</i>,
      giving a singularly full and soft tone-colouring to the whole. A draft
      score, unfortunately incomplete, in Mozart's handwriting, testifies to a
      later abandoned attempt for a similar song. The superscription is "<i>Scena
      con Rondo</i>"<a href="#linknote36-23" name="linknoteref36-23"
      id="linknoteref36-23"> 23 </a> the person indicated, Susanna. The
      beginning of the recitative, both in words and music, is like that of the
      better-known <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p094.png">[94]</a></span> song, and it
      expresses the same idea somewhat more diffusely as it proceeds, closing in
      B flat major. The solitary leaf preserved breaks off at the eighth bar of
      the rondo; only the voice-part and the bass are given&mdash;[See Page

    </p>
    <p>
      but even this fragment of text and melody suffices to show a complete
      contrast to the air just mentioned. A little ariette preserved in Mozart's
      original score and marked "Susanna" (579 K.), has still less of the
      delicate characterisation which we admire so much in the opera.<a

      are trifling, and so commonplace that they suggest no particular
      situation. Even the music, hastily thrown together and light in every
      respect, expresses only a superficially excited mood. If, as is probable,
      the air was intended for the dressing scene,<a href="#linknote36-25"
      name="linknoteref36-25" id="linknoteref36-25"> 25 </a> the want of
      individual characterisation <span class="side">SUSANNA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p095.png">[95]</a></span> becomes all
      the more observable. It would be a great mistake to consider the character
      of Susanna as a mere expression of amorous sensuality. This side of it is
      judiciously displayed first without any reserve, in order to throw into
      relief her not less real qualities of devoted affection, faithful service,
      and refined and playful humour. The very scene, not in itself altogether
      unobjectionable, in which the ladies disguise the page, is turned into an
      amusing joke by Susanna's innocent and charming merriment. Susanna's air
      in this scene (Act II., 3) is, technically speaking, a cabinet piece. The
      orchestra executes an independent piece of music, carefully worked-out and
      rounded in most delicate detail, which admirably renders the situation,
      and yet only serves as a foil to the independent voice-part. A tone of
      playful humour runs through the whole long piece from beginning to end; it
      is the merriment of youth, finding an outlet in jest and teasing,
      expressed with all possible freshness and grace. But the high spirit of
      youth does not exclude deeper feelings where more serious matters are
      concerned; in the terzet (Act II., 4) where Susanna in her hiding-place
      listens to the dialogue between the Count and Countess, she displays deep
      emotion, and expresses her sympathy with truth and gravity. Mozart has
      indeed grasped this painful situation with a depth of feeling which raises
      the terzet far above ordinary opera buffa.<a href="#linknote36-26"
      name="linknoteref36-26" id="linknoteref36-26"> 26 </a> In her relations to
      Figaro, Susanna displays now one, now the other side of her nature. It is
      judiciously arranged that immediately succeeding her first heartfelt,
      though not sentimental expression of love (Act I., 1), the second duet
      (Act I., 2), should display her merry humour. Her consciousness of
      superiority over Figaro, who learns the Count's designs first through her,
      combined with the ease of her relations towards them both, resulting from
      the honesty of her love, enable her to carry off the difficult situation
      with <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p096.png">[96]</a></span> a spirit and youthful gaiety
      which contrast with Figaro's deeper emotions. He begins indeed with
      unrestrained merriment, but the same motif, mockingly repeated by Susanna,
      becomes a warning which has so serious an effect upon him that not even
      her endearments can quite succeed in chasing the cloud from his brow.<a
      href="#linknote36-27" name="linknoteref36-27" id="linknoteref36-27"> 27
      </a> The ground-tone of the duet, the intercourse of affianced lovers, is
      expressed with the utmost warmth and animation, and places us at once in
      the possession of the true state of affairs. Before the end comes,
      however, we see the couple testing each other's fidelity and measuring
      their intellectual strength against each other, as when in the last finale
      Susanna, in the Countess's clothes, puts Figaro to the proof, and he,
      recognising her, takes his clue accordingly. This duet sparkles with life
      and joviality, rising, after the explanation, to the most winning
      expression of tender love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters of the Countess and Cherubino are much less complicated
      than that of Susanna. The Countess is represented as a loving wife,
      injured by a jealous and faithless husband. The musical characterisation
      gives no suggestion of any response, however faint and soon stifled, to
      the page's advances, but is the most charming expression of ideal purity
      of sentiment. She suffers, but not yet hopelessly, and the unimpaired
      consciousness of her own love forbids her to despair of the Count's. Thus
      she is presented to us in her two lovely songs. The calm peace of a noble
      mind upon which sorrow and disappointment have cast the first light shadow&mdash;too
      light seriously to trouble its serenity&mdash;is expressed with intensest
      feeling in the first air (Act II., 1). The second (Act III., 4),
    </p>
    <p>
      when she is on the point of taking a venturous step to recall the Count to
      her side, is more agitated, and, in spite of the melancholy forebodings
      which she cannot quite repress, gives expression to a joyful hope of
      returning happiness. There is no strong passion even here; the Count's
      affronts <span class="side">CHERUBINO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p097.png">[97]</a></span> excite her anger, and the dilemma
      in which she is, placed awakens her youthful pleasure in teasing. This
      reminiscence of Rosina in earlier years, combined with the consciousness
      of her true feeling, so finely expressed by the music, may in some measure
      supply the motive for the deceit which she thinks herself justified in
      using towards the Count. Signora Laschi, who took the part of the
      Countess, was highly esteemed in Italy, but was not a great favourite in
      Vienna.<a href="#linknote36-28" name="linknoteref36-28"
      id="linknoteref36-28"> 28 </a> Signora Bussani, on the other hand, who
      appeared for the first time as the page, although not a singer of the
      first rank, was much admired by the public for her beautiful figure and
      unreserved acting,<a href="#linknote36-29" name="linknoteref36-29"
      id="linknoteref36-29"> 29 </a> or as Da Ponte says, for her <i>smorfie</i>
      and <i>pagliacciate</i>.<a href="#linknote36-30" name="linknoteref36-30"
      id="linknoteref36-30"> 30 </a> "Cherubino is undoubtedly one of the most
      original of musical-dramatic creations, Beaumarchais depicts a youth,
      budding into manhood, feeling the first stirrings of love, and unceasingly
      occupied in endeavouring to solve the riddle which he is to himself. Count
      Almaviva's castle is not a dwelling favourable to virtue, and the handsome
      youth, who pleases all the women he meets, is not devoid of wanton
      sauciness: "Tu sais trop bien," he says to Susanna, "que je n'ose pas
      oser." To Susanna, with whom he can be unreserved, he expresses the
      commotion of his whole nature in the celebrated air (Act I., 6) which so
      graphically renders his feverish unrest, and his deep longing after
      something indefinable and unattainable. The vibration of sentiment, never
      amounting to actual passion, the mingled anguish and delight of the
      longing which can never be satisfied, are expressed with a power of beauty
      raising them out of the domain of mere sensuality, Very remarkable is the
      simplicity of the means by which this extraordinary effect is attained. A
      violin accompaniment passage, not unusual in itself, keeps up the restless
      movement; the harmonies make no striking progressions, strong emphasis and
      accents are sparingly used, and yet the <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI
      FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p098.png">[98]</a></span>
      soft flow of the music is made suggestive of the consuming glow of
      passion. The instrumentation is here of very peculiar effect and of quite
      novel colouring; the stringed instruments are muted, and clarinets occur
      for the first time and very prominently, both alone and in combination
      with the horns and bassoons.<a href="#linknote36-31"
      name="linknoteref36-31" id="linknoteref36-31"> 31 </a> The romanze in the
      second act (2) is notably different in its shading. Cherubino is not here
      directly expressing his feelings; he is depicting them in a romanze, and
      he is in the presence of the Countess, towards whom he glances with all
      the bashfulness of boyish passion. The song is in ballad form, to suit the
      situation, the voice executing the clear, lovely melody, while the
      stringed instruments carry on a simple accompaniment <i>pizzicato</i>, to
      imitate the guitar; this delicate outline is, however, shaded and animated
      in a wonderful degree by solo wind instruments. Without being absolutely
      necessary for the progress of the melodies and the completeness of the
      harmonies, they supply the delicate touches of detail reading between the
      lines of the romanze, as it were, what is passing in the heart of the
      singer. We know not whether to admire most the gracefulness of the
      melodies, the delicacy of the disposition of the parts, the charm of the
      tone-colouring, or tenederness of the expression&mdash;the whole is of
      entrancing beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily we have lost a third air written for Cherubino. After the sixth
      scene of the second act, in which Barberina requests the page to accompany
      her, the original draft score contains the remark: "<i>Segue Arietta di
      Cherubino; dopo l'Arietta di Cherubino viene scena 7, ma ch' è un
      Recitativo istromentato con Aria della Confessa</i>," This arietta is not
      in existence, and probably never was, a change in the arrangement of the
      scenes having rendered it superfluous. This is to be regretted;
      Cherubino's intercourse with Barberina would have supplied an essential
      feature which is now wanting in the opera. But even as it is, the image of
      <span class="side">DANCE&mdash;MARCH.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p099.png">[99]</a></span> Cherubino is so attractive, so
      original, that it must unquestionably be reckoned among the most wonderful
      of Mozart's creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we see all the <i>dramatis personæ</i> live and move as human beings,
      and we unconsciously refer their actions and demeanour to their individual
      natures, which lie before us clear and well-defined. So great a master of
      psychological characterisation was under no necessity of calling
      accessories of costume or scenery to his aid, and declined even to remind
      us by the use of peculiar musical forms that the action was laid in Spain.
      This device is only once resorted to. The dance which is performed during
      the wedding festivities in the third act (Act III., 8, p. 377) reminds us
      so forcibly of the customary melody for the fandango,<a
      href="#linknote36-32" name="linknoteref36-32" id="linknoteref36-32"> 32
      </a> that there can be no doubt this dance was known in Vienna at the
      time. Gluck has employed the same melody in his ballet of "Don Juan,"
      produced at Vienna in 1761. If Mozart's adaptation be compared with the
      other two, it will be perceived that he has formed a free and independent
      piece of music out of some of the characteristic elements of the original,
      combining dignity and grace in a singular degree; the treatment of the
      bass and middle pans, and the varied combinations u of the wind
      instruments heighten the effect of the unusual colouring. At the
      exclamation of the Gotmt, who has pricked himself with a pin the bassoon
      strikes up in plaintif tones:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      which are comically appropriate. But they are not primarily introduced to
      express pain; they belong to the dance music, and recur at the same point
      later on in the dance; the point of the joke is the apparently chance
      coincidence of the dance music with the situation of the moment. The fine
      march preceding the ballet, the gradual approach of which produces a very
      effective climax (Vol. II., p. 154, note), takes its <span class="side">LE
      NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p100.png">[100]</a></span>
      peculiar colouring from the constant transition to the minor in the wind
      instruments&mdash;[See Page Images]&mdash;without having any very decided
      national character. Neither are the choruses sung on the same occasion by
      female voices, or male and female together, particularly Spanish in tone,
      any more than the chorus in the first act (Act I., 8); they are gay,
      fresh, very graceful, and exactly fitted to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto we have attempted an exposition only of the musical-dramatic
      characteristics of the opera, the psychological conception which makes the
      actions of the characters correspond with their individual nature... Not
      less important are the events and circumstances which give rise to the <i>combined
      action</i> of the different characters; in the opera this is displayed in
      ensemble movements. The prevailing principle is here again truth in the
      expression of feeling; but the juxtaposition of the different characters
      necessitates a greater stress to be laid on individual peculiarities;
    </p>
    <p>
      and again, these characteristics of detail must be subordinated to the
      main idea of producing a well-formed whole. A due balance of parts can
      only be produced by compliance with the conditions of a musical work of
      art. The substance and form of these ensemble movements are of course
      subject to many modifications; many of them are nothing more than a
      detailed and fuller exposition of some definite situation or mood; and
      their whole design is therefore simple. Such are the duets between Figaro
      and Susanna (Act I., i, 2), between Susanna and Marcellina (Act I., 5),
      the writing duet (Act III., 5), and the duet between the Count and Susanna
      (Act III., 1); they are distinguished from airs more by their form than
      their nature. If during the dressing scene Cherubino were to chime in with
      Susanna's remarks, the Countess were also directly to interpose, such a
      duet or terzet would represent the situation in greater variety of detail,
      the form would become richer by means of contrasting <span class="side">ENSEMBLES.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p101.png">[101]</a></span>
      elements, but the musical matter would not differ essentially from that to
      which we are accustomed in solo airs. The terzet in the second act is of
      this character; a situation or a mood is maintained, and only variously
      mirrored in the various personages. Here, then, is the point of departure
      for unity in the grouping of the whole; and the ordinary resources of
      musical construction, such as the repetition of a motif in different
      places, the elaboration and combination of the motifs, for the most part
      lend themselves to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty of the task increases in proportion as the music forms
      part-of the plot. We have an instance of this in the duet between Susanna
      and Cherubino (Act II., 5); when the latter tries to escape, and finally
      jumps out of the window. The simple situation gives rise to an expression
      of fear and disquiet in short, interrupted motifs, and the prevailing
      characteristic is an agitation almost amounting to action__in progress.
      The agitation, however, is so characteristically rendered by the music,
      that, while appearing to flow from an irresistible impulse, it is in
      reality only an effect of a definite musical formula fitly working out a
      given motif. The orchestral part forms a separate piece of music of very
      varied character.<a href="#linknote36-33" name="linknoteref36-33"
      id="linknoteref36-33"> 33 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The terzet of the first act comes in the very middle of the action (Act
      I., 7). Here we have not merely three persons of dissimilar natures thrown
      together, but at the particular point in the plot their interests and
      sentiments are altogether opposed, and each of them is influenced by
      different suppositions. The plot proceeds, however, and the discovery of
      the page in the arm-chair gives a turn to affairs which changes the
      position of each person present. We are struck in the first place with the
      striking, delicately toned musical expression, especially when the voices
      go together, as at the beginning, when the Count's anger: "Tosto andate e
      scacciate il <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p102.png">[102]</a></span> seduttor!"
      Basilio's lame excuse: "In mal punto son qui giunto," and Susanna's
      distress: "Che ruina, me meschina!" are all blended into a whole, while
      preserving throughout their individual characters. The same is the case at
      the end also, when the Count, taken by surprise, turns his displeasure
      against Susanna in ironical expressions: "Onestissima signora, or capisco
      come và"; while she is anxious on her own account: "Accader non puo di
      peggio!" and Basilio gives free expression to his malice: "Cosi fan tutte
      le belle!" But while the music appears only to follow the plot, we cannot
      fail on closer examination to perceive that I we have before us a work
      constructed and carried out I according to the strictest laws of musical
      form. It is all so naturally and easily put together that what is really
      owing to deep artistic insight might be considered by the uninitiated as
      the result of a fortuitous coincidence of dramatic and musical effects.
      The intensely comic effect produced by Basilio's repetition of his
      previous sentence, a fifth higher is brought about of necessity by the
      musical form. A similar effect is produced when, at the point where a
      return to the original key leads us to expect a recurrence of the
      principal subject, the Count, with the same notes in which he had
      exclaimed, full of resentment at Susanna's intercession; "Parta, parta il
      damerino!" now turns to Susanna herself with the words: "Onestissima
      signora, or capisco come và," the point being brought out by the change
      from <i>forte</i> to <i>pianissimo</i>. Traits like this of delicate
      dramatic characterisation proceed immediately from the musical
      construction, and are to be ascribed solely to the composer; the text does
      not by any means directly suggest them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatic interest reaches a far higher level in the two great finales.
      The finale to the second act is judiciously constructed, as far as is
      compatible with musical exigences, out of the elements already existing in
      Beaumarchais. The dramatic interest rises with the increasing number of
      persons taking part in the action, and grows to a climax, while new
      developments proceeding from the unravelling of each complication bring
      the actors into ever-varying relations with each other. The different
      situations afford the most <span class="side">FINALES.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p103.png">[103]</a></span> animated
      variety, moving onwards in close connection, but each one keeping its
      ground long enough to give ample scope for musical elaboration.<a
      href="#linknote36-34" name="linknoteref36-34" id="linknoteref36-34"> 34
      </a> The situations thus give rise to the eight movements, distinct in
      design and character, which form the finale. The masterly combination of
      the different movements is more effective than would be any amount of
      emphasis laid on particular points of characterisation. The finale opens
      with a manifestation of intensest passion&mdash;the Count glowing with
      rage and jealousy, the Countess, wounded to the heart, trembling at the
      consequences of her imprudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no other part of the opera is the pathetic element express so
      prominent, the conflict being so strongly expressed that a serious
      catastrophe appears inevitable. But Susanna's unexpected appearance brings
      about an explanation, which could not be more aptly expressed than by the
      rhythmical motif of the second movement.<a href="#linknote36-35"
      name="linknoteref36-35" id="linknoteref36-35"> 35 </a> Susanna's mocking
      merriment, which for a moment rules the situation, is in some degree
      moderated by the uncertainty of the two others. The want of repose of the
      following movement alters the character again, while the chief characters
      have to adapt themselves to their change of relative position. The Count
      has to propitiate his wife, without being altogether convinced himself;
      the Countess's anger and forgiveness both come from the heart, but she
      feels that she is not now quite in the right. Susanna is exerting herself
      to bring about explanation and reconciliation, and in so doing takes
      involuntarily, as it were, the upper hand of the Countess. It is a mimic
      war, carried on in the most courteous manner; every emotion is broken and
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us turn to the music. A succession of short motifs, each of which
      characterises a particular element of the situation, are loosely put
      together, none of them independently worked out, one driving out the
      other. But the <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p104.png">[104]</a></span> motifs occur
      in every case just where dramatic expression demands, and each repetition
      throws a new light upon the situation, turning the apparent confusion into
      a well-formed musical whole. Figaro brings an element of unrestrained
      gaiety into the midst of this troubled atmosphere; the G major following
      immediately on the E flat major breaks away from all that has gone before.
      His merriment is truly refreshing, but even he feels some constraint
      knowing that his secret is betrayed, without being aware of what has led
      to it. The eagerness with which the Count interrupts him, the anxiety with
      which the women seek to put him in the right way, his alternate holding
      back and yielding, give the scene a diplomatic sort of tone, wonderfully
      well-rendered by a tinge of dignity in the music, which only here and
      there betrays, involuntarily as it were, more animation. The closing
      ensemble gives to each of the four voices a mysterious character which is
      quite inimitable. A complete contrast to this delicate play is afforded by
      the half-drunken gardener with his denunciation; this opponent requires
      quite a different treatment. The musical characterisation becomes more
      lively and broader, the different features more strongly marked. As soon
      as the Count begins his examination of Figaro, the tone alters again. The
      remarkable andante 6-8 in which the beating motif&mdash;[See Page Image]
      is hurried through the most varied harmonic transitions expresses an
      impatience which is scarcely to be kept from violent explosion, quite in
      accordance with the suspense with which the progress of the explanation is
      followed by all present without arriving at any satisfactory solution.
      Finally Marcellina enters with her confederates. The firm, bold pace which
      is at once adopted by the music marks the commencement of a new struggle;
      the peril becomes serious, and the change of situation brings about a new
      <span class="side">FINALES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p105.png">[105]</a></span> disposition of the characters.
      Marcellina, Basilio and Bartolo range themselves on one side, the
      Countess, Susanna and Figaro on the other, both parties aggressive and
      prepared for the fight, the Count between them turning first to the one
      side and then to the other. When the crisis is over, and Marcellina's
      claim acknowledged, the previous positions are reversed; Marcellina's
      party has the advantage, Figaro's is defeated. The vanquished party now
      lose self-command and become violently agitated, while the victors express
      their triumph with mocking composure. The finale ends in doubled tempos
      with a diffuse but decided expression of those discordant moods on both
      sides, bringing the long strife and confusion to an end.<a
      href="#linknote36-36" name="linknoteref36-36" id="linknoteref36-36"> 36
      </a> The plan of the second finale is quite different; we plunge at once
      into the midst of an animated intrigue, one misapprehension and surprise
      following close upon another. The Countess, disguised as Susanna, awaits
      the Count; Figaro, and Susanna listen concealed; first the page enters,
      then the Count, and the play proceeds, every one getting into the wrong
      place, receiving what is not meant for him, and addressing himself to the
      wrong person. Mozart has only grasped the amusing side of the
      complication, and the music maintains a cheerful, lively character,
      without leaving room for any expression of deeper feeling. By this means
      whatever is objectionable in the situation seems to spring unavoidably as
      it were from the facts of the case, on which the play is founded and
      developed. It is sufficiently astonishing that the music should succeed in
      following this development step by step in all its turns; the higher art
      of the master is displayed in his power of representing dramatic life and
      reality in all its perfection within the limits of a musical movement of
      scientific conception and form. Nowhere perhaps is the style of intrigue
      which Zelter praises as the special quality of the opera<a
      href="#linknote36-37" name="linknoteref36-37" id="linknoteref36-37"> 37
      </a> brought <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p106.png">[106]</a></span> so
      prominently forward as in this ensemble. It consists in the art of making
      each character express himself naturally and appropriately, at the same
      time rendering the due meaning of the situation and throwing the right
      light on every separate utterance, while giving the whole a brighter
      colouring. As soon as Figaro and Susanna are opposed to each other, the
      tone and style are altered. Serious genuine feeling breaks through the
      mask of deception, and asserts its sway. Not until the Count enters does
      the trickery begin again, leading to a succession of surprises which find
      their climax in the appearance of the Countess. The music renders so
      bewitchingly the impression of her pardoning gentleness and amiability
      that we are forced to believe in the sincerity of the reconciliation, and
      to share in the rejoicings which follow on so many troublous events.<a
      href="#linknote36-38" name="linknoteref36-38" id="linknoteref36-38"> 38
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to these two finales a prominent position is assigned to the sestet
      (Act III., 3) which according to Kelly was Mozart's favourite piece in the
      whole opera.<a href="#linknote36-39" name="linknoteref36-39"
      id="linknoteref36-39"> 39 </a> This partiality is characteristic, for his
      amiable nature finds fuller expression in this piece than in any other.
      The trial scene is omitted in the opera, but the recognition of Figaro by
      Marcellina and Bartolo is brought into the foreground. The cool sarcastic
      tone of Beaumarchais gives this scene something unpleasant; but the
      musical version even here allows human sentiment to assert itself; if it
      were not for the extraordinary circumstances on which the scene is founded
      it would be quite pathetic. Both the parents and the son are in the act of
      expressing the tenderest affection and delight when Susanna hastens in to
      redeem Figaro. The violence with which she manifests her anger at Figaro's
      apparent want of constancy is meant quite seriously, and is necessary in
      order to show how deeply her heart is affected. Amid the caresses of her
      supposed rival she learns the truth, the charming melody to which
      Marçellina had made herself known to her <span class="side">THE SESTET.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p107.png">[107]</a></span> son
      being transferred to the orchestra while she acquaints Susanna of her
      relationship to Figaro. Susanna, incredulous of the wonderful story,
      demands confirmation from each person present in turn, and the situation
      assumes a comic character, consisting however only in the unexpected turn
      of events, not in the sentiments of the persons interested, who only wish
      to be quite sure of their facts before giving themselves up to unmitigated
      delight. Once assured of their happiness, it overflows in fervent
      gratitude with an enchanting grace that invests the happy lovers with a
      sort of inspired and radiant beauty. Mozart has added very much to the
      effect by keeping the whole passage <i>sotto voce</i>, a device which he
      always employs with deep psychological truth.<a href="#linknote36-40"
      name="linknoteref36-40" id="linknoteref36-40"> 40 </a> But the lovers are
      not alone, and the contrast afforded by the other personages present
      prevents the purely idyllic character which would be incongruous in this
      scene. One of these is the Count, who with difficulty restrains his rage
      so far as not to commit himself. The other is the stupid, stuttering
      judge, Don Curzio, who has pronounced judgment as the Count's tool, and is
      now amazed at what is passing before him; incapable of an idea, he says
      first one thing and then another, and finally takes refuge in obsequiously
      following the opinions of his lord and master. The striking musical effect
      of the high tenor going with the Count's deep bass gives an expression of
      cutting irony, and emphasises the stupidity of the judge who chimes in
      with the Count, without in the least entering into the passions which
      agitate him. Don Curzio serves here the same purpose as Basiliain the
      terzet of the first act, mingling a comic element with the expression of a
      deeper emotion, and modifying, without injuring, the serious ground-tone
      of the piece. This mode of construction is altogether Mozart's own, and is
      a striking testimony to his power of grasping and delineating dramatic
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly narrates that Mozart begged him not to stutter <span class="side">LE
      NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p108.png">[108]</a></span>
      while he was singing lest the impression of the music should be disturbed.
      He answered that it would be unnatural if a stutterer should lose his
      defect as soon as he began to sing, and undertook to do no harm to the
      music. Mozart gave in at last, and the result was so successful that the
      sestet had to be repeated, and Mozart himself laughed inordinately. He
      came on the stage after the performance, shook Kelly by both hands and
      thanked him, saying: "You were right and I was wrong."<a
      href="#linknote36-41" name="linknoteref36-41" id="linknoteref36-41"> 41
      </a> This was doubtless very amiable of Mozart, but his first view was the
      right one, nevertheless. The artifice might succeed in a master of
      mimicry, but Don Curzio ought certainly not to be made the principal
      person in the sestet. On the contrary, he might well be omitted altogether
      as a musical pleonasm; at least, if Basilio were to be brought in and made
      to take the same part in the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sestet may be taken as an excellent example of the manner in which
      Mozart turned his means of representation to account. We are struck first
      of all with his power of grouping so as to produce a clear and distinct
      whole. The effect and appreciation of music depends, like architecture, on
      symmetry. Even though a strict parallelism of the different component
      parts may be in all but certain cases inapplicable, yet their symmetry
      must be always present to the apprehension of the hearers. In the musical
      drama the characterisation of the situation dominates the construction
      side by side with the laws of musical form. In the sestet before us
      Marcellina, Bartolo, and Figaro form a natural group, announcing
      themselves at once as connected from a musical point of view, Marcellina
      and Bartolo closely corresponding, Figaro forming the uniting member of
      the little group. Opposed to them we have the Count and Don Curzio, who
      also keep together, but with greater freedom of independent movement.
      Susanna's entry introduces a new element. At first she opposes Figaro, and
      allies herself to the Count, and we have then two strongly characteristic
      groups of three persons, each with a construction and <span class="side">TREATMENT
      OF THE VOICE PARTS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p109.png">[109]</a></span> movement of its own. The
      explanation which ensues necessitates the dissolving of the ensemble into
      a monologue, after which the situation is changed. Susanna goes over to
      Figaro, Marcellina, and Bartolo, and fresh group is formed, with Susanna
      as the chief member, though the others do not by any means renounce their
      independence. Against this concentrated force the discontented minority
      gives expression to additional energy and resentment, coming to an end in
      unison. These hints will suffice to show with what a firm mind of the
      hearers an impression of the perfect freedom of dramatic action, within
      the limits of strict and simple musical form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great stress laid upon dramatic reality necessitated in general simple
      forms and moderate execution in the musical part of the work. In the airs
      the traditional form of two elaborate movements is only exceptionally
      employed the cavatina or rondo form being in most cases preferred and
      treated freely, although with considerable precision the majority of the
      duets are similar in design, Mozart having usually written over them <i>duettino,
      arietta</i>, But neither confined limits nor dramatic interest have been
      made a pretext for the neglect of well-constructed, well-rounded form;
    </p>
    <p>
      he never fails to hit upon the right point, whence a whole may be
      organised. Thus, every separate passage in the finale heightens the
      contrast, and leads by a 'natural process of development to a conclusion
      for which '+ helps to prepare the way. What has been said in general terms
      may be applied to the treatment of details, and primarily of the voices.
      The dramatic characterisation necessitates perfect freedom in the
      employment of every source of effect; long-drawn cantilene shorter
      melodious phrase; well-marked motifs requiring elaborate working-out,
      declamatory delivery merging into an easy conversational tone&mdash;all
      are employed in their right place, often in rapid alternation and varied
      combination. It is not sufficient, however that each separate device
      should be employed effectively the essential point is that they should be
      placed in right relations with each other, and with the whole of which
      hand the musical edifice is put together so as to leave on the <span
      class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p110.png">[110]</a></span> they form parts. The
      unhesitating use of the resources of the voice, and the harmony of the
      effect, are admirable alike in the great ensemble movements and in the
      smallest passage to be sung; the sestet and the second duet may be brought
      forward as essentially differing in style and subject, yet each in its
      place distinguished by delicacy of detail and striking effect. Great
      simplicity in the treatment of the voices is a noteworthy consequence of
      this tendency. Song is merely the means adopted for expressing emotion of
      different kinds. Homely simplicity not only corresponds to truth of
      expression&mdash;it is necessary for the combination of heterogeneous
      motives, which would otherwise be incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simplicity, however, is not of the kind that reduces all expression
      to the same level, and abjures ornament and grace; rather is it the
      simplicity of a nature which draws its inspiration from the depths of the
      heart, and excludes all merely virtuoso-like displays which would serve
      but to glorify the singer.<a href="#linknote36-42" name="linknoteref36-42"
      id="linknoteref36-42"> 42 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      An important aid to characterisation and colouring was found by Mozart in
      the orchestra. We know by what means he had prepared and cultivated every
      part of a full orchestra as a means of characteristic expression and
      euphonious charm. His contemporaries were particularly impressed by his
      use of wind instruments, and in point of fact they were little likely ever
      to have experienced before the sensations produced by the tender
      interweaving of the wind instruments in Cherubino's romanze (Act II., 2),
      or their soft, melting sounds in his air (Act I., 6). In these days we
      should, indeed, appreciate rather Mozart's moderation in the employment of
      wind instruments. Trombones are never used, and trumpets and drums only in
      the overture the march with a chorus (Act III., 7), the closing passages
      of the finales, and in three airs: those of Bartolo (Act I., 4), Figaro
      (Act I., 9), and the Count (Act III., 2). This is not saying much; true
      moderation consists, not so much in <span class="side">THE ORCHESTRA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p111.png">[111]</a></span>
      abstaining from certain methods, as in the way in which those which are
      employed are held in check. Equally admirable is the masterly treatment of
      the stringed instruments which form the groundwork of the orchestra, at
      the same time that the independent movements of the separate instruments
      develop a fresh and ever-varied vivacity. Mozart has striven above all to
      preserve a healthy balance of sound effects, and a unity of treatment
      which never aims at brilliant effects brought about either by an
      ostentatious extra vagance or an exaggerated economy in the use of his
      resources; the right effect is produced at the right point, and in the
      simplest manner, regard being always had to the laws of climax. The
      simplicity of the voice parts necessitates a corresponding simplicity in
      the instrumental parts! most distinctly appreciable where they occur
      obbligato. A comparison with "Idomeneo" and the "Entführung" in this
      respect will bring out the difference very strongly. The orchestra in the
      "Entführung" is treated more easily and simply than in "Idomeneo"; in
      "Figaro" the highest degree of clearness is united with abundant fulness
      and intensive force of instrumental colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position here accorded to the orchestra may be regarded as not so much
      an improvement on earlier operas as an essentially new conception of its
      powers and functions.<a href="#linknote36-43" name="linknoteref36-43"
      id="linknoteref36-43"> 43 </a> The orchestra appears For the first time
      not only as an integral part of the whole, but as one with equal rights,
      taking an independent and active part in the musical-dramatic
      representation. Such a conception could only be realised when the
      orchestra and instrumental music had been developed and cultivated as they
      were by Haydn and Mozart. In this independent position it is neither above
      nor in opposition to the voices, but each is indispensable to the due
      effect of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra is no longer to be looked upon as a mere accompaniment to
      the voices, but as an independent and co-operating means of
      representation. And as such we find it in "Figaro." In many passages the
      orchestra seems to take the lead&mdash;as, for instance, in the dressing
      scene (Act II., 3), when the animated, <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI
      FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p112.png">[112]</a></span>
      delicately worked-out orchestral passages not only hold the threads
      together, but develop the characterisation. At other times the orchestra
      forms the foundation in the working-out of motifs upon which the voices
      are suffered to move freely, as in the duet between Susanna and Cherubino
      (Act II., 5) and in different passages of the finales, the andante 6-8 of
      the first finale and the first passage of the second. There are, indeed,
      few numbers in which the orchestra does not temporarily undertake one or
      the other office, in order to assist the characterisation. The orchestra
      is never employed in this way with better effect than in the so-called
      "writing-duet" (Act III., 5). At the close of the recitative the Countess
      dictates the title, "canzonetta sull' aria," and as soon as Susanna begins
      to write, the oboes and bassoons take up the ritornello, and undertake to
      tell, as it were, what Susanna is writing when she is silent and the
      Countess dictates.<a href="#linknote36-44" name="linknoteref36-44"
      id="linknoteref36-44"> 44 </a> There is a trace here of a subsequent
      editorial alteration. Instead of the present closing bars of recitative,
      which are inserted in the original score by a strange hand, there were
      originally quite different ones, to which the little duet in B flat major
      could not have immediately succeeded. They probably served as an
      introduction to a lively scene between the Countess and Susanna, similar
      to that in Beaumarchais' dialogue. This is confirmed by the first sketch
      of the writing-duet, which, with the title "Dopo il Duettino," only
      prefixes the words of the Countess as recitative: "Or via, scrivi cor mio,
      scrivi! gia tutto io prendo su me stessa." So close an approximation of
      two duets was most likely the cause of the rejection of the first, with
      the words of the recitative which called it forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detached features of the orchestral treatment, important as they may be,
      however, do not constitute its peculiar character; many of them had been
      previously and successfully attempted by other musicians. The essential
      point consists in the orchestra taking part, as it were, in the action, so
      that more often than not the instrumental parts would <span class="side">THE
      ORCHESTRA&mdash;OVERTURE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p113.png">[113]</a></span> form a complete and satisfying
      whole without any voice parts at all. The orchestra, of course, frequently
      executes the same melodies as the voices, but it treats them in an
      original manner, producing a constant flow of cross effects with the
      voices. Sometimes again it works out its own independent motifs, and adds
      shading and detail to the outlines furnished by the voices. It is not
      possible to over-estimate the share thus taken by the orchestra in
      maintaining the main conception of the situation, in increasing the
      dramatic reality and interest of the plot, and in strengthening the
      impression made upon the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capabilities of instrumental music in this direction are most
      strikingly displayed in the overture, in composing which Mozart appears to
      have kept before him the second title of Beaumarchais' play, "La Folle
      Journée." He has made one very characteristic alteration in the course of
      the overture. At first the rapid impetuous presto was interrupted by a
      slower middle movement. In the original score the point where the return
      to the first subject is made (p. 13) is marked by a pause on the
      dominant-seventh, followed by an andante 6-8 in D minor of which, however,
      only one bar is preserved:&mdash;[See page image]
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p114.png">[114]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaf on which its continuation and the return to the presto was
      sketched is torn out, and the portion between <i>vi</i> and <i>de</i>
      crossed through.<a href="#linknote36-45" name="linknoteref36-45"
      id="linknoteref36-45"> 45 </a> It is plain that Mozart altered his mind
      when he came to the instrumentation of the overture, which he had sketched
      in the usual way. Perhaps a middle movement beginning like a Siciliana did
      not please him; in any case, he thought it better not to disturb the
      cheerful expression of his opera by the introduction of any foreign
      element. And in very truth the merry, lively movement pursues its
      uninterrupted course from the first eager murmur of the violins to the
      final flourish of trumpets. One bright, cheerful melody succeeds another,
      running and dancing for very lightness of heart, like a clear mountain
      stream rippling over the pebbles in the sunshine. A sudden stroke here and
      there electrifies the motion; and once, when a gentle melancholy shines
      forth, the merriment is as it were transfigured into the intensest
      happiness and content. A piece of music can hardly be more lightly and
      loosely put together than this; there is an entire want of study or
      elaboration. Just as the impulses of a highly wrought poetic mood exist
      unobserved, and pass from one to the other, so here one motif grows out of
      the other, till the whole stands before us, we scarce know how.
    </p>
    <p>
      A not less important office is undertaken by the orchestra in assisting
      the psychological characterisation, not only by giving light and shade and
      colouring through changes of tone-colouring and similar devices
      unattainable by the voices, but by taking a positive part in the rendering
      of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      No emotion is so simple as to be capable of a single decided and
      comprehensive expression. To the voices is intrusted the task of depicting
      the main features, while the orchestra undertakes to express the secondary
      and even 'the contradictory impulses of the mind, from the conflict of
      which arise emotions capable of being expressed in music alone of all the
      arts. We can scarcely wonder that Mozart's <span class="side">FIGARO AS AN
      OPERA BUFFA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p115.png">[115]</a></span>
      contemporaries, surprised at the novelty of his orchestral effects, failed
      to appreciate their true meaning,<a href="#linknote36-46"
      name="linknoteref36-46" id="linknoteref36-46"> 46 </a> nor that his
      imitators confined themselves to the material result, and failed to
      perceive the intellectual significance of the improved instrumentation.<a
      href="#linknote36-47" name="linknoteref36-47" id="linknoteref36-47"> 47
      </a> The freedom with which Mozart employs voices and orchestra together
      or apart to express dramatic truths can only exist as the highest result
      of artistic knowledge and skill. The independence with which each element
      cooperates as if consciously to produce the whole presupposes a perfect
      mastery of musical form. True polyphony is the mature fruit of
      contrapuntal study, although the severe forms of counterpoint are seldom
      allowed to make themselves visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up, there can be no doubt that Mozart's "Figaro" must be ranked
      above the ordinary performances of opera buffa on higher grounds than its
      possession of an interesting libretto, a wealth of beautiful melody, and a
      careful and artistic mechanism. The recognition of truth of dramatic
      characterisation as the principle of musical representation was an immense
      gain, and had never even been approached by opera buffa, with its
      nonsensical tricks and caricatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rossini himself said that Mozart's "Figaro" was a true <i>dramma giocoso</i>,
      while he and all other Italian composers had only composed <i>opere buffe</i>.<a
      href="#linknote36-48" name="linknoteref36-48" id="linknoteref36-48"> 48
      </a> Even though we acknowledge the influence of French opera on Mozart
      (Vol. II., p. 342) as formed by Gluck,<a href="#linknote36-49"
      name="linknoteref36-49" id="linknoteref36-49"> 49 </a> and still more by
      Grétry (Vol. II., p. 15),<a href="#linknote36-50" name="linknoteref36-50"
      id="linknoteref36-50"> 50 </a> the first glance suffices to show that
      Mozart's superior musical cultivation enabled him to employ the resources
      of his art to <span class="side">LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p116.png">[116]</a></span> a far greater
      degree than Grétry. Granting also Grétry's undoubted powers of dramatic
      characterisation and expression of emotion, Mozart's nature is also in
      these respects far deeper and nobler. Nothing can be more erroneous than
      the idea that Mozart's merit consisted in taking what was best from
      Italian and French opera, and combining them into his own; it was solely
      by virtue of his universal genius' that he was enabled to produce an opera
      which is at once dramatic, comic, and musical. Chance has decreed that
      "Figaro" should be an Italian adaptation of a French comedy, set to music
      by a German; and this being so serves only to show how national
      diversities can be blended into a higher unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance by way of comparison at the Italian operas which competed in some
      respects successfully with "Figaro," such as Sarti's "Fra due litiganti il
      terrzo godef" Paesiello's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barbiere di Seviglia" and "Re Teodoro," Martin's "Cosa Rara and "Arbore
      di Diana," or Salieri's "Grotta di Trofonio," may at first excite surprise
      that they contain so much that reminds us of Mozart, and which we have
      learnt to identify with Mozart, knowing it only through him. But a nearer
      examination will show that this similarity is confined to form, for the
      most part to certain external turns of expression belonging to the time,
      just as certain forms of speech and manner belong to different periods. In
      all essential and important points, careful study will serve only to
      confirm belief in Mozart's originality and superiority. All the operas
      just mentioned have qualities deserving of our recognition. They are
      composed with ease and cleverness, with a full knowledge of theatrical
      effect and musical mechanism, and are full of life and merriment, of
      pretty melodies, and capital intrigue. But Mozart fails in none of these
      qualities, and only in minor matters do these other works deserve to be
      placed side by side with his. None of them can approach him even in some
      matters of detail, such as the treatment of the orchestra, or the grouping
      of the ensembles. What is much more important, however, they fail
      altogether in that wherein consists Mozart's true pre-eminence: in the
      intellectual organisation, the psychological depth, the <span class="side">VIENNA,
      1786.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p117.png">[117]</a></span>
      intensity of feeling, and consequent power of characterisation, the firm
      handling of form and resource, proceeding from that power, and the purity
      and grace which have a deeper foundation than merely sensual Beauty. Those
      operas have long since disappeared from the stage, because no amount of
      success in details will preserve in being any work uninteresting as a
      whole. Mozart's "Figaro" lives on the stage, and in every musical circle;
      youth is nourished on it, age delights in it with ever-increasing delight.
      It requires no external aid for its apprehension; it is the pulse-beat of
      our own life which we feel, the language of our own heart that we catch
      the sound of, the irresistible witchery of immortal beauty which enchains
      us&mdash;it is genuine, eternal art which makes us conscious of freedom
      and bliss.

      THE success of "Figaro" did not materially improve Mozart's position in
      Vienna. He lived, it is true, in very pleasant intercourse with a large
      circle of friends, especially with the members of the Jacquin family (Vol.
      II., p. 357), but the necessity he was under of earning his living as a
      music teacher and virtuoso was very galling to him. "You happy man!" said
      he to Gyrowetz, who was setting out on a journey to Italy; "as for me, I
      am off now to give a lesson, to earn my bread."<a href="#linknote37-1"
      name="linknoteref37-1" id="linknoteref37-1"> 1 </a> A glance at the

      We cannot wonder that he turned a willing ear to the entreaties of his
      English friends, that he would leave Vienna in the autumn of 1786 (his
      wife having presented him on October 27, 1786, with their third son,
      Leopold, who died the following spring) and visit England; this plan was
      seriously considered, and only abandoned upon his father's strong
      opposition to it (Vol. II., p. 274). There soon after reached him an
      invitation from another quarter, giving still greater prospect of success
      and encouragement. "Figaro" made its way but slowly to most of the other
      great towns of Europe,<a href="#linknote37-2" name="linknoteref37-2"
      id="linknoteref37-2"> 2 </a> but in Prague, where the "Entführung" had
      left a very pleasing impression, it was performed at once, and with the
      greatest success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The national taste for music which early distinguished <span class="side">MUSIC
      IN BOHEMIA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p119.png">[119]</a></span>
      the Bohemians, and which they retain to the present day, arrived at a high
      stage of development during the last century.<a href="#linknote37-3"
      name="linknoteref37-3" id="linknoteref37-3"> 3 </a> The zealous attention
      bestowed upon church music both in town and country, and the cultivated
      taste of the nobility, gave to talent an easy recognition, and no
      available forces, either vocal or instrumental, were suffered to remain in
      neglect. It was the "custom and obligation" for every head of a school to
      write at least one new mass during the year, and to perform it with his
      scholars. Any youth who distinguished himself was placed in an institution
      where he was able to continue his musical education; there was no lack of
      patrons ready to support him until he found a situation in the musical
      establishment of a prince, a prelate, or a monastery.<a
      href="#linknote37-4" name="linknoteref37-4" id="linknoteref37-4"> 4 </a>
      "The families of Morzini, Hartiggi, Czemini, Mannsfeldi, Netolizki,
      Pachta, &amp;c., were the patrons of many young men; they took them from
      the village schools on their territories and brought them to the capital
      to swell the ranks of their private musical establishments; they wore a
      livery, and formed part of their retinue of servants. Riflemen were not
      allowed to wear a uniform until they could blow the bugle perfectly. Many
      noble families in Prague required their livery servants to have a
      knowledge of music before being considered competent for service." Under
      these circumstances, music and all connected with it must have been held
      in high estimation at Prague, where the aristocracy were wont to
      congregate during the winter. A permanent Italian opera, especially
      intended for opera buffa, was founded by Bustelli, who had also obtained a
      license in Dresden in 1765. From that time until 1776 he gave performances
      at both places with a select <span class="side">MOZART IN PRAGUE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p120.png">[120]</a></span>
      company, and acquired great fame thereby.<a href="#linknote37-5"
      name="linknoteref37-5" id="linknoteref37-5"> 5 </a> His successor was
      Pasquale Bondini, who afterwards gave performances in Leipzig during the
      summer,<a href="#linknote37-6" name="linknoteref37-6" id="linknoteref37-6">
      6 </a> and who was able to uphold the ancient fame of the Italian opera in
      Prague. First-rate artists, such as Jos. Kucharz and Jos. Strobach were
      engaged as operatic conductors; and other distinguished musicians were
      engaged, as, for instance, Joh. Kozeluch (a relation of Mozart's opponent
      living in Vienna, Leopold Kozeluch), Wenzel Praupner, Vincenz Maschek,
      &amp;c. There was, however, one artistic couple in Prague of peculiar
      interest from their influential position and their intimate friendship
      with Mozart. These were the Duscheks, whose name we have already had
      frequent occasion to mention.<a href="#linknote37-7" name="linknoteref37-7"
      id="linknoteref37-7"> 7 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz Duschek (born 1736 in Chotinborek), while still a poor peasant lad,
      attracted the notice of his feudal lord, Count Joh. Karl von Spork, by his
      uncommon talent. He was first sent to study at the Jesuit seminary at
      Königgràtz, but being obliged to give up study owing to an unfortunate
      accident, he devoted himself entirely to music, and was sent by the Count
      to Vienna, where he was educated into an accomplished piano-forte-player
      by Wagenseil.<a href="#linknote37-8" name="linknoteref37-8"
      id="linknoteref37-8"> 8 </a> As such he had long held the first rank in
      Prague, and not only did much by his excellent teaching to advance the art
      of pianoforte-playing, but exercised a decided and beneficial influence on
      musical taste in general. He was universally esteemed as an honest and
      upright man, and his influence with distinguished connoisseurs made him a
      powerful patron of foreign artists visiting Prague. His hospitable house
      formed a meeting-point both for foreign and native talent, and concerts
      were regularly given there on certain days in the week. The animating
      spirit at all these meetings was Duschek's wife Josepha (neé Hambacher),<a
      href="#linknote37-9" name="linknoteref37-9" id="linknoteref37-9"> 9 </a>
      who had received her musical education from <span class="side">MADAME
      DUSCHEK.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p121.png">[121]</a></span>
      him. She played the pianoforte well enough to pass for a virtuoso, and
      made some not unsuccessful attempts as a composer; but her forte lay in
      singing. Her beautiful, full, round voice was admired equally with her
      delivery, which was especially fine in recitative; she accomplished the
      most difficult bravura passages with perfect ease, without neglecting the
      effect of a perfect <i>portamento</i>; she united fire and energy with
      grace and expression&mdash;in short, she maintained in every respect her
      claim to be ranked with the first Italian singers of her time. This claim
      was not, it is true, acknowledged by Leopold Mozart; when she was in
      Salzburg with her husband, in 1786, he wrote to his daughter (April)&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Duschek sang; but how? I cannot but say that she shrieked out an
      air of Naumann's with exaggerated expression, just as she used to do, only
      worse. Her husband is answerable for this; he knows no better, and has
      taught her, and persuades her that she alone possesses true taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her appearance did not please him either. "She seems to me to show signs
      of age already," he writes (April 13); "she has rather a fat face, and was
      very carelessly dressed." Schiller's unfavourable remarks upon her in
      Weimar, where she was in May, 1788, are quite in accordance with this.<a
      href="#linknote37-10" name="linknoteref37-10" id="linknoteref37-10"> 10
      </a> She displeased him by her assurance (Dreistigkeit)&mdash;he would not
      call it impudence (Frechheit)&mdash;and her mocking manner, which caused
      the reigning Duchess to observe that she looked like a discarded mistress.<a
      href="#linknote37-11" name="linknoteref37-11" id="linknoteref37-11"> 11
      </a> By favour of the Duchess Amalie she was allowed to give three
      concerts for the display of her talent and the general edification; Korner
      answers Schiller's account of her:<a href="#linknote37-12"
      name="linknoteref37-12" id="linknoteref37-12"> 12 </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duchess is not so wrong in what she said of her. She did not interest
      me very greatly. Even as an artist, I consider her expression caricatured.
      Gracefulness is, in my estimation, the chief merit of song, and in this
      she seems to me entirely wanting.

    <p>
      I have found a dear and talented friend of those happy youthful days in
      Madame Duschek, who retains her old frankness and love for all that is
      beautiful. Her voice, and her grand, expressive delivery, have been a
      source of true pleasure to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a true friend also to Mozart. In 1777 the Duscheks were in
      Salzburg, where they had family connections who were acquainted with the
      Mozarts. Wolfgang took great pleasure in the society of the young lively
      singer, and if she showed a disposition to hold aloof from Salzburg folk
      in general, he too was "schlimm," as he called it, in this respect. Of
      course he composed several songs for her (Vol. I., p. 234). The Duscheks
      discovered Wolfgang's uncomfortable position in Salzburg; and the
      intelligence that he intended shortly to leave the town drew from them,
      his father says (September 28, 1777), expressions of the warmest sympathy.
      They begged Wolfgang, whether he came to Prague then or at any other time,
      to rely upon the most friendly welcome from them. In the spring of 1786
      they came to Vienna, and were witness of the cabals against which Mozart
      had to contend before the performance of his "Figaro." They were quite
      able to judge for themselves what the opera was likely to be, and after
      the success which had attended the performance of the "Entführung" in
      Prague they found no difficulty in rousing interest there in the new
      opera:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Figaro" was placed upon the stage in 1786 by the Bondini company, and was
      received with an applause which can only be compared with that which was
      afterwards bestowed on the "Zauberflote." It is a literal truth that this
      opera was played almost uninterruptedly during the whole winter, and that
      it completely restored the failing fortunes of the entrepreneur. The
      enthusiasm which it excited among the public was unprecedented; they were
      insatiable in their demands for it. It was soon arranged for the
      pianoforte, for wind instruments, as a quintet for chamber music, and as
      German dance music; songs from "Figaro" <span class="side">PERFORMANCE OF

      were heard in streets, in gardens; even the wandering harper at the
      tavern-door was obliged to strum out "Non più andrai" if he wanted to gain
      any audience at all.<a href="#linknote37-15" name="linknoteref37-15"

      Fortunately this enthusiastic approbation was turned to the profit of the
      one whom it most concerned. Leopold Mozart wrote to his daughter with
      great satisfaction (January 12, 1787):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Your brother is by this time in Prague with his wife, for he wrote to me
      that he was to set out last Monday. His opera "Le Nozze di Figaro" has
      been performed there with so much applause that the orchestra and a number
      of connoisseurs and amateurs sent him a letter of invitation, together
      with some verses that had been written upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conjectured that they would take up their abode with Duschek, whose
      wife was absent on a professional journey to Berlin; but a greater honour
      was in store for them. Count Johann Joseph Thun, one of the noblest
      patrons of music in Prague, had placed his house at Mozart's disposal. He
      accepted the offer gladly, and on his arrival at Prague, in 1787, he found
      the public enthusiastic for his music, and well-disposed towards himself.
      The account which he addressed to Gottfried von Jacquin (January 15, 1787)
      is written in the highest spirits:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearest Friend!&mdash;At last I find a moment in which to write to you; I
      intended to write four letters to Vienna immediately on my arrival, but in
      vain! only a single one (to my mother-in-law) could I attempt, and that I
      only wrote the half of; my wife and Hofer were obliged to finish it.
      Immediately upon our arrival (Thursday, the 11th, at noon) we had enough
      to do to be ready for dinner at one. After dinner old Count Thun regaled
      us with music performed by his own people, and lasting about an hour and a
      half. I can enjoy this true entertainment daily. At six o'clock I drove
      with Count Canal to the so-called Breitfeld Ball, where the cream of
      Prague beauty are wont to assemble. That would have been something for
      you, my friend! I think I see you after all the lovely girls and women&mdash;not
      running&mdash;no, limping after them. I did not dance, and did not make
      love. The first because I was too tired, and the last from my native
      bashfulness; but I was quite pleased to see all these people hopping about
      to the music of my "Figaro" turned into waltzes and country dances;
      nothing is talked of here but <span class="side">MOZART IN PRAGUE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p124.png">[124]</a></span>
      "Figaro," no opera is cared for but "Figaro," always "Figaro"&mdash;truly
      a great honour for me. Now to return to my diary. As I returned late from
      the ball, and was tired and sleepy from my journey, it was only natural
      that I should sleep long; and so it was. Consequently the whole of the
      next morning was <i>sine linea</i>; after dinner we had music as usual;
      and as I have a very good pianoforte in my room, you can easily imagine
      that I did not allow the evening to pass without some playing; we got up a
      little quartet <i>in caritatis camera</i> (and the "schone Bandl hammera,"
      [Vol. II., p. 362] ) among ourselves; and in this way the whole evening
      again passed <i>sine linea.</i> I give you leave to quarrel with Morpheus
      on my account; he favoured us wonderfully in Prague; why, I cannot tell,
      but we both slept well. Nevertheless, we were ready at 11 o'clock to go to
      Pater Unger, and to give a passing glance at the Royal Library and at the
      Seminary. After we had looked our eyes out, we felt a small menagerie in
      our insides, and judged it well to drive to Count Canal's to dinner. The
      evening surprised us sooner than you would believe, and we found it was
      time for the opera. We heard "Le Gare Generose" (by Paesiello). As to the
      performance, I can say little, for I talked all the time; the reason I did
      so, against my usual custom, must have been because&mdash;but <i>basta</i>&mdash;this
      evening was again spent <i>al solito</i>. To-day I am fortunate enough to
      find a moment in which to inquire after your welfare and that of your
      parents, and of the whole family of Jacquin. Now farewell; next Friday,
      the 19th, will be my concert at the theatre; I shall probably be obliged
      to give a second, and that will lengthen my stay here. On Wednesday I
      shall see and hear "Figaro"&mdash;at least if I am not deaf and blind by
      that time. Perhaps I shall not become so until <i>after</i> the opera.

      At the performance of "Figaro" Mozart was received by the numerous
      audience with tumultuous applause; he was so pleased with the
      representation, especially with the orchestral part of it, that he
      expressed his thanks in a letter to Strobach, who conducted it. The Prague
      orchestra was not strongly appointed,<a href="#linknote37-16"
      name="linknoteref37-16" id="linknoteref37-16"> 16 </a> nor did it shine
      through the names of celebrated virtuosi; but it contained clever and
      well-schooled musicians, full of fire and of zeal for what was good&mdash;the
      best guarantee of success. Strobach often asserted that he and his
      orchestra used to get so excited by "Figaro" that, in spite of the actual
      labour it entailed, they would willingly have played it all over again
      when they came to the end.<a href="#linknote37-17" name="linknoteref37-17"

      The two concerts which Mozart gave in Prague were also highly successful:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The theatre was never so full, and delight was never so strongly and
      unanimously roused as by his divine playing. We scarcely knew which to
      admire most, his extraordinary compositions or his extraordinary playing;
      the two together made an impression on our minds comparable only to
      enchantment.<a href="#linknote37-18" name="linknoteref37-18"
      id="linknoteref37-18"> 18 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already given an account of the enthusiasm excited by Mozart's
      extemporising (Vol. II., p. 438); the other compositions which he
      performed were all loudly applauded, especially the lately written
      symphony in D major. The pecuniary gain corresponded to the warmth of this
      reception, and Storace was able to announce to L. Mozart that his son had
      made 1,000 florins in Prague. The social distractions which Mozart
      describes so graphically to his friend appear to have continued; at least,
      he accomplished no musical work except the country dances which he
      improvised for Count Pachta (510 K.; Vol. II., p. 436), and six waltzes
      (509 K.), composed for the grand orchestra, probably for a similar
      occasion (February 6, 1787).<a href="#linknote37-19"
      name="linknoteref37-19" id="linknoteref37-19"> 19 </a> When, however, in
      the joy of his heart Mozart declared how gladly he would write an opera
      for an audience which understood and admired him like that of Prague,
      Bondini took him at his word, and concluded a contract with him by which
      Mozart undertook to compose an opera by the beginning of the next season
      for the customary fee of one hundred ducats.<a href="#linknote37-20"

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. "DON GIOVANNI."

    </p>
    <p>
      MOZART had been so well satisfied with Da Ponte's libretto for "Figaro"
      that he had no hesitation in intrusting the new libretto to him, and
      immediately on his return to Vienna they consulted together as to the
      choice of subject. Da Ponte, fully convinced of the many-sidedness of
      Mozart's genius, proposed "Don Giovanni," and Mozart at once agreed to it.
      Da Ponte relates,<a href="#linknote38-1" name="linknoteref38-1"
      id="linknoteref38-1"> 1 </a> with an amusing amount of swagger, that he
      was engaged at one and the same time on "Tarar" for Salieri, on the
      "Arbore di Diana" for Martin, and on "Don Giovanni" for Mozart. Joseph II.
      made some remonstrance on this, to which Da Ponte answered that he would
      do his best; he could write for Mozart at night and imagine himself
      reading Dante's "Inferno"; for Martin in the morning, and be reminded of
      Petrarch; and in the evening for Salieri, who should be his Tasso.
      Thereupon he set to work, a bottle of wine and his Spanish snuffbox before
      him, and his hostess's pretty daughter by his side to enact the part of
      inspiring muse. The first day, the two first scenes of "Don Giovanni," two
      scenes of the "Arbore di Diana," and more than half of the first act of
      "Tarar" were written, and in sixty-three days the whole of the first two
      operas and two-thirds of the last were ready. Unfortunately we have no
      certain information either of the share taken by Mozart in the
      construction of the text, nor of the manner in which his composition was
      carried on. The warmth of his reception at Prague made the contrast of his
      position in Vienna all the more galling to him. On the departure of
      Storace, Kelly, and Attwood for England, in February, 1787, he had
      seriously entertained the idea of following them as soon as they had found
      a situation worthy of his acceptance <span class="side">VIENNA, 1787&mdash;DITTERSDORF.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p127.png">[127]</a></span> in
      London. The bass singer Fischer, who was visiting Vienna,<a
      href="#linknote38-2" name="linknoteref38-2" id="linknoteref38-2"> 2 </a>
      wrote in Mozart's album on April 1, 1787, the following verses, more
      well-meaning than poetical:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Die holde Göttin Harmonie Der Tone und der Seelen,
     Ich dächte wohl, sie sollten nie
     Die Musensöhnen fehlen,
     Doch oft ist Herz und
     Mund verstimmt;
     Dort singen Lippen Honig,
     Wo doch des Neides Feuer glimmt&mdash;
     Glaub mir, es gebe wenig Freunde die den
     Stempel tragen Echter Treu, Rechtschaffenheit.
</pre>
    <p>
      The lines throw a light on Mozart's relations to his fellow-artists, and
      the hint contained in Barisani's album verses, written on April 14, 1787,
      that the Italian composers envied him his art (Vol. II., p. 306), leaves
      no doubt as to whose envy, in the opinion of himself and his friends, he
      had to dread. A musical connoisseur, visiting Vienna on his return from
      Italy in the spring of 1787,<a href="#linknote38-3" name="linknoteref38-3"
      id="linknoteref38-3"> 3 </a> found everybody engrossed with Martin's "Cosa
      Rara," which, Storace's departure having rendered its performance in
      Italian impossible, was being played in a German adaptation at the
      Marinelli theatre with success. Dittersdorfs success in German opera had
      also the effect of throwing Mozart completely into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dittersdorf (1739-1799)<a href="#linknote38-4" name="linknoteref38-4"
      id="linknoteref38-4"> 4 </a> came to Vienna during Lent, 1786,<a
      href="#linknote38-5" name="linknoteref38-5" id="linknoteref38-5"> 5 </a>
      to produce his oratorio of "Job" at the concerts of the Musical Society,
      and he afterwards gave two concerts in the Augarten, at which his
      symphonies on Ovid's "Metamorphoses" were performed. The genuine success
      of these compositions led to his being requested to write a German opera.
      Stephanie junior, theatrical director at the time, provided him with the
      incredibly dull libretto of the "Doctor und Apotheker," which was played
      for the first <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p128.png">[128]</a></span> time on July 11, 1786, and
      twenty times subsequently during the year. That which had not been
      attained by the success of the "Entführung," happened in this case.
      Dittersdorf was at once requested to write a second opera, "Betrug durch
      Aberglauben," which was performed on October 3, 1786, with not less
      applause than the first; it was followed by a third "Die Liebe im
      Narrenhause," also very well received on April 12, 1787. On the other
      hand, an Italian opera by Dittersdorf, "Democrito Corretto," first
      performed on January 2, 1787, was a complete failure. Dittersdorf's
      brilliant triumph over such composers as Umlauf, Hanke, or Ruprecht, is
      not to be wondered at; his operas rapidly spread from Vienna to all the
      other German theatres, and he acquired a popularity far in excess of most
      other composers.<a href="#linknote38-6" name="linknoteref38-6"
      id="linknoteref38-6"> 6 </a> True merit was undoubtedly at the bottom of
      this; he was skilful in appropriating the good points both of opera buffa
      and of French comic opera, and his finales and ensemble movements are
      specially happy in effect; he was not only thoroughly experienced in the
      management of voices, but, being a fertile instrumental composer, he had
      learnt from the example and precedent of Haydn to employ his orchestra
      independently, and with good effect. His easy flow of invention furnished
      him with an abundance of pleasing melodies, a considerable amount of comic
      talent showed itself in somewhat highly flavoured jokes, and his music had
      an easy-going, good-tempered character, which, though often sinking into
      Philistinism, was, nevertheless, genuinely German. Far behind Grétry as he
      was in intellect and refinement, he decidedly excelled him in musical
      ability. Life and originality were incontestably his, but depth of feeling
      or nobility of form will be sought for in vain in his works. Each new
      opera was a mere repetition of that which had first been so successful,
      affording constant proof of his limited powers, which were rightly
      estimated by some of his contemporaries.<a href="#linknote38-7"

      public for Dittersdorf's lighter style of music, and rewarded him
      munificently when he left Vienna in the spring of 1787. But the Emperor
      took no real interest in German opera&mdash;the company received their
      dismissal in the autumn of 1787, and the performances ceased in February,

      Mozart's autograph Thematic Catalogue contains few important works between
      his return to Vienna and his second journey to Prague:&mdash;

    </p>

      (Vol. III., p. 19) (515 K.).

      May 16. Quintet, G minor (Vol. III., p. 20) (516 K.).

    <p>
      August 24. Pianoforte sonata with violin, in A major (526 K.).

      These were probably all composed for social or teaching purposes; even the
      two quintets, which are worthy of the first rank, were no doubt written to
      order for a particular musical circle. Nor were these compositions to the
      taste of the Viennese public of the day. The traveller already mentioned
      notes as follows:<a href="#linknote38-9" name="linknoteref38-9"

      Kozeluch's works hold their ground, and are always acceptable, while
      Mozart's are not by any means so popular. It is true; and the fact
      receives fresh confirmation from his quartets dedicated to Haydn, that he
      has a decided leaning to what is difficult and unusual. But on the other
      hand, how great and noble are his ideas&mdash;how daring a spirit does he
      display in them!
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount of industry with which Mozart worked at "Don Giovanni" is
      unknown to us. We may conclude that, if he followed his usual habit, he
      plunged eagerly into his new libretto at first, and afterwards
      procrastinated over <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p130.png">[130]</a></span> the actual
      transcription of his ideas. The received tradition represents him as
      bringing the unfinished opera to Prague in September, 1787,<a
      href="#linknote38-10" name="linknoteref38-10" id="linknoteref38-10"> 10
      </a> and completing it, incited by intercourse with the intended
      performers and the stimulating society of his enthusiastic friends and
      admirers.<a href="#linknote38-11" name="linknoteref38-11"
      id="linknoteref38-11"> 11 </a> The impresario, who was bound to provide
      accommodation for the composer until after the performance, had lodged
      Mozart in a house, "bei drei Löwen" (on the market-place).<a
      href="#linknote38-12" name="linknoteref38-12" id="linknoteref38-12"> 12
      </a> He preferred, however, the vineyard of his friend Duschek at Kossir
      (Kosohirz); and the summer-house and stone table are still shown at which
      he used to sit writing his score, with lively talk and bowl-playing going
      on round him.<a href="#linknote38-13" name="linknoteref38-13"

      diplomacy with which Mozart apportioned the several parts to the
      satisfaction of the performers, of his having been obliged to appease L.
      Bassi, indignant at Don Giovanni having no proper grand air to sing; of
      his having composed "La ci darem la mano" five times before he could
      satisfy the singers,<a href="#linknote38-14" name="linknoteref38-14"

      his <span class="side">PERFORMANCE IN PRAGUE, 1787.</span> <span

      with the female performers.<a href="#linknote38-15" name="linknoteref38-15"
      id="linknoteref38-15"> 15 </a> As to this, we know his relations with the
      Duscheks; Teresa Saporiti is said to have expressed her surprise that so
      great an artist should be so insignificant in appearance; whereat Mozart,
      touched on his weakest point, diverted his attentions from her and
      bestowed them on Micelli or Bondini&mdash;there were no other female
      artists in Prague at that time. We are unfortunate in having no
      information as to the influence exerted on the details of the composition
      by the idiosyncracies of the singers and other circumstances. Two
      anecdotes obtained credence at the time, both relating to the rehearsals
      for which Da Ponte had also come from Vienna;<a href="#linknote38-16"
      name="linknoteref38-16" id="linknoteref38-16"> 16 </a> he was lodged at
      the back of the inn "Zum Platteis," and the poet and composer could
      converse with each other from their respective windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the finale of the first act Teresa Bondini as Zerlina failed to utter
      the cry for help in a sufficiently spontaneous manner. After many vain
      attempts, Mozart went himself on to the stage, had the whole thing
      repeated, and at the right moment gave the singer so unexpected and severe
      a push that she shrieked out in alarm. "That's right," he exclaimed,
      laughing, "that is the way to shriek!" The words of the Commendatore in
      the churchyard scene were originally, it is said, accompanied only by the
      trombones. The trombone-players failing to execute the passage, Mozart
      went to the desk, and began to explain how it might be done, whereupon one
      of them said: "It cannot be played in that way, nor can even you teach us
      how to do it." Mozart answered, laughing: "God forbid that I should teach
      you to play the trumpet; give me the parts, and I will alter them." He did
      so accordingly, and added the wood wind instruments.<a

      A good omen for the reception of the new opera was afforded by a brilliant
      performance of "Figaro" on October 14,<a href="#linknote38-18"
      name="linknoteref38-18" id="linknoteref38-18"> 18 </a> under Mozart's
      direction, in honour of the bride of Prince Anton of Saxony, the
      Archduchess Maria Theresa of Toscana, who was passing through Prague on
      her wedding tour.<a href="#linknote38-19" name="linknoteref38-19"
      id="linknoteref38-19"> 19 </a> Nevertheless, Mozart himself felt far from
      secure of the success of "Don Giovanni"; and after the first rehearsal,
      while taking a walk with the orchestral conductor Kucharz, he asked him in
      confidence what he thought of the opera, and whether it was likely to
      achieve so decided a success as that of "Figaro." Kucharz answered that he
      could entertain no doubt of the success of such fine and original music,
      and that anything coming from Mozart would meet with ready recognition
      from the Prague public. Mozart declared himself satisfied with such an
      opinion from a musician, and said he was ready to spare neither pains nor
      labour to produce a work worthy of Prague.<a href="#linknote38-20"

      Thus approached the day of performance, October 29 (not November 4), 1787;
      and on the previous evening the overture was still unwritten, to the great
      consternation of Mozart's assembled friends. We have already told (Vol.
      II., p. 414) how he parted late from the merry company, and sat down to
      write with a glass of punch before him, and his wife telling him stories
      by his side; how sleep overcame him, and he was obliged to lie down for
      several hours before completing his task; and how the copyist was sent for
      at seven o'clock in the morning, and the overture was ready at <span

      the appointed time.<a href="#linknote38-21" name="linknoteref38-21"
      id="linknoteref38-21"> 21 </a> There was barely time to write out the
      parts before the beginning of the opera, which indeed was somewhat delayed
      on this account. The well-drilled and inspired orchestra played the
      overture at sight so well that, during the introduction to the first act,
      Mozart observed to the instrumentalists near him: "Some of the notes fell
      under the desks, it is true, but the overture went capitally upon the
      whole." The success of the first representation was brilliant. The theatre
      was full to overflowing, and Mozart's appearance as conductor at the piano
      was the signal for enthusiastic clapping and huzzas. The suspense with
      which the overture was awaited found vent in a very storm of applause,
      which accompanied the opera from beginning to end. The cast of this
      performance was as follows:&mdash;[See Page Images]

      The performance, though not including any virtuosi of the first rank or
      fame, was considered an excellent one; the inspiring influence of the
      maestro and the elevated mood of the public united to induce the
      performers to put forth all their powers, and stimulated them to
      extraordinary efforts. Guardasoni, who was associated with Bondini in the
      management of the theatre,<a href="#linknote38-22" name="linknoteref38-22"

      Mozart met with constant and unequivocal proofs of esteem on all sides
      during his visit to Prague; an esteem, too, not of mere fashion or
      prejudice, but founded on a genuine love of art; he gave himself up
      unreservedly to the pleasure afforded him by intercourse with his friends
      and admirers; and many of these retained long after, as Niemet-schek says
      (p. 93), the memory of the hours passed in his society. He was as artless
      and confiding as a child, and overflowing with fun and merriment; it was
      difficult for <span class="side">SONG FOR MADAME DUSCHEK, 1787.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p135.png">[135]</a></span>
      strangers to realise that they were in the society of the great and
      admired artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart had promised his friend, Madame Duschek, that he would compose a
      new concert air for her; as usual, however, he could not be brought to the
      point of transcribing it. One day she locked him into a summer-house on
      the Weinberg, and declared she would not let him out until he had finished
      the air. He set to work at once, but having completed his task, retorted
      that if she could not sing the song correctly and well at first sight, he
      would not give it to her.<a href="#linknote38-25" name="linknoteref38-25"
      id="linknoteref38-25"> 25 </a> In truth, the words: "Quest' affanno,
      questo passo è terribile," in the andante of this song ("Bella mia
      fiamma," 528 K., part 2) are rendered after a highly characteristic
      manner; and the intervals for the voice, not easy in themselves, become,
      by their harmonic disposition, a severe test of pure and correct
      intonation. Altogether, this is one of the most beautiful of Mozart's
      concert airs; it makes no great claims on the singer's powers of
      execution, but it requires a soprano voice of considerable compass and
      power, and a grand and expressive delivery. It is interesting to observe
      how this song, animated and energetic as it is in expression, yet differs
      essentially from the properly dramatic music of "Don Giovanni."
      Unconnected with any plot, and not designed for the stage, the situation
      adopts a modified character, the concert singer being in a totally
      different position from the actor; and the form in which the composer
      clothes his conception is suitably modified also. On November 15, 1787,
      immediately after Mozart's return to Vienna, Gluck died; and the success
      of "Don Giovanni" in Prague may have contributed to induce Joseph II. to
      retain Mozart in Vienna by appointing him Chamber-Musi-cian
      (Kammermusikus) on December 7, 1787. For the present, however, there was
      no prospect of a performance of "Don Giovanni" in Vienna.

      Salieri had produced his opera of "Tarar" in Paris, in June, 1787,
      Beaumarchais having spared no pains to create <span class="side">DON
      GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p136.png">[136]</a></span>
      an effect by a lively and exciting plot, by lavish decorations and
      costumes, and by political and philosophical allusions. The public was at
      first somewhat disappointed, and the music was considered inferior to that
      of the "Danaides," produced in 1774; but the extraordinary piece made in
      the end a great effect, and attracted large audiences.<a
      href="#linknote38-26" name="linknoteref38-26" id="linknoteref38-26"> 26
      </a> The Emperor was exceedingly pleased with the music, and commissioned
      Da Ponte to prepare Italian words for it upon the occasion of the marriage
      of the Archduke Francis with the Princess Elizabeth. This Italian opera of
      "Axur" retained only the groundwork of the original, both the words and
      the music being completely remodelled. Da Ponte gave fresh proof of his
      dexterity, and Salieri, finding his task far more congenial than before,
      did not grudge the trouble of recomposition.<a href="#linknote38-27"
      name="linknoteref38-27" id="linknoteref38-27"> 27 </a> On January 8, 1788,
      the Festival opera "Axur" was performed as a "Freispektakel," the

      aback by the traces of the French "Tarar" in the Italian "Axur," but very
      soon they felt the lively, brilliantly appointed plot, and the freer

      essentially Italian music. Several representations, following in quick
      succession, increased the favour in which this opera came to be held in
      Vienna,<a href="#linknote38-29" name="linknoteref38-29"

      The present, therefore, was no time for "Don Giovanni." Mozart catered for
      the amusement of the Viennese by the dances (534-536 K.), which he wrote
      in January, 1788, for the balls in the Redoutensaale, and he indulged his
      patriotic feelings by a song on the Turkish war, which Baumann sang at the
      theatre in the Leopoldstadt (539 K.). He <span class="side">PERFORMANCE IN
      VIENNA, 1788.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p137.png">[137]</a></span>
      appears also to have given a concert during Lent, for which he wrote his
      pianoforte concerto in D major (537 K.). But Joseph II. commanded the
      production of "Don Giovanni," and there was no more to be said; it was
      given on May 7, 1788,<a href="#linknote38-32" name="linknoteref38-32"
      id="linknoteref38-32"> 32 </a> and was a failure. Everybody, says Da
      Ponte,<a href="#linknote38-33" name="linknoteref38-33"
      id="linknoteref38-33"> 33 </a> except Mozart, thought it a mistake;
      additions were made, airs were altered, but no applause followed.
      Nevertheless Da Ponte took Mozart's advice, and had the opera repeated
      several times in quick succession, so that people grew accustomed to what
      was unusual, and the applause increased with every representation.<a

      There was no reason, as will be acknowledged, to ascribe the tardy success

      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p138.png">[138]</a></span>
      exaggerated with respect to the frequent alterations. Mozart's Thematic
      Catalogue contains three pieces for insertion written <i>before</i> the
      first performance (April 24, 28, 30) and incorporated in the book of
      words.<a href="#linknote38-36" name="linknoteref38-36"
      id="linknoteref38-36"> 36 </a> Mdlle. Cavalieri, of whom it was said at
      the time<a href="#linknote38-37" name="linknoteref38-37"
      id="linknoteref38-37"> 37 </a> that, deserving to be placed in the first
      rank of Italian singers, and almost deified as she was in Italy, not a
      word in her praise was ever uttered in Vienna, insisted on having a grand
      scena in the part of Elvira, in order to maintain her reputation as a
      singer. This gave rise (April 30) to the magnificent air "Mi tradi quell'
      alma ingrata" (527, 25 K.).<a href="#linknote38-38" name="linknoteref38-38"
      id="linknoteref38-38"> 38 </a> Mozart could not indeed persuade himself to
      sacrifice so much to the "voluble organ of Mdlle. Cavalieri" as he had
      formerly done in the "Entführung" (Vol. II., p. 235), but even as it is,
      the dramatic interest has to yield to the vocal&mdash;the character of
      Elvira to the individuality of the singer. The tenor singer, Signor
      Francesco Morelia,<a href="#linknote38-39" name="linknoteref38-39"
      id="linknoteref38-39"> 39 </a> on the contrary, seems to have found
      Ottavio's grand air too much for him, and the air in G major "Della sua
      pace" (527, 27 K.), composed for him is more modest in every respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stronger effort after popularity was made by the duet between Zerlina
      and Leporello, "Per queste tue manine" (527, 28 K.). The situation is
      broadly comic, and has no proper connection with the plot; Leporello is
      roundly abused, and finally tied hand and foot by Zerlina. It was probably
      intended as a sacrifice to the taste of the audience, who expected an
      opera buffa to make them laugh heartily. We know that Benucci was an
      excellent comedian in every branch of his art, and this duet leads to the
      conclusion that Signora Mombelli's forte was buffa. Zerlina expresses her
      anger and revenge volubly enough, but her own special grace <span
      class="side">CRITIQUES ON DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p139.png">[139]</a></span> and roguery have quite deserted
      her here. In a true opera buffa the duet would have been quite in keeping;
      but it is out of place in "Don Giovanni," because it brings Leporello and
      Zerlina to the foreground in a degree which does not accord with the plot,
      and places them both in a harsh light, false to their character as
      elsewhere displayed. Mozart was right, then, in his opinion that additions
      and alterations were not the means to make his opera gain favour; it was
      altogether too unusual a phenomenon to take immediate effect upon a
      Viennese audience. We have already seen how Haydn was constrained to put
      to silence the adverse criticisms of musicians and connoisseurs assembled
      at Count Rosenberg's, by declaring his conviction that Mozart was the
      greatest composer in the world. "Don Giovanni" first made its way upon the
      stages of Germany in German adaptations. It was given at Mannheim with
      extraordinary success in October, 1789,<a href="#linknote38-40"
      name="linknoteref38-40" id="linknoteref38-40"> 40 </a> and Schroder
      produced it in Hamburg at about the same time; Schink, while severely
      criticising the libretto of the opera, expresses himself enthusiastically
      in praise of the music&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      How can this music, so full of force, majesty, and grandeur, be expected
      to please the lovers of ordinary opera, who bring their ears to the
      theatre with them, but leave their hearts at home? The grand and noble
      qualities of the music in "Don Juan" will appeal only to the small
      minority of the elect. It is not such as to tickle the ear of the crowd,
      and leave the heart unsatisfied. Mozart is no ordinary composer. His music
      has been profoundly felt and thought out in its relation to the
      characters, situations, and sentiments of his personages. It is a study in
      language, treated musically. He never decks out his songs with unnecessary
      and meaningless passages. That is the way in which expression is banished
      from music: expression consisting not in particular words, but in the
      skilful and natural combination of sounds as a medium of real emotion. Of
      this method of expression Mozart is a consummate master. Each sound which
      he produces has its origin in emotion, and overflows with it. His
      expression is glowing with life and picturesqueness, yet without the taint
      of voluptuousness. He has the richest, and at the same time the most
      temperate imagination. He is a true virtuoso, never allowing his creative
      impulse to run away with his judgment; his inspiration is guided by
      reason, his impersonations are the result of calm deliberation.<a

      The Berlin criticism was not quite so favourable, the opera having been
      there performed for the first time in the presence of the King on December
      20, 1790:<a href="#linknote38-42" name="linknoteref38-42"

      If ever an opera was looked forward to with curiosity, if ever a
      composition of Mozart's was lauded to the skies before its performance, it
      was surely this "Don Juan." Every one will allow that Mozart is a great
      and admirable composer, but that nothing good or great has been written
      before this opera, or will be written after it, is a point on which we may
      be allowed to doubt. Theatrical music admits of no rules, of no appeal but
      to the heart, and its worth is in proportion to its effect thereon. No
      amount of art in heaping up instrumental effects will make a great
      musician or render his name immortal, unless he can give utterance to the
      passions and emotions of the heart. Grétry, Monsigny, and Philidor are
      instances to the point. Mozart has aimed at writing something
      extraordinary, something inimitably grand in his "Don Juan"; the
      extraordinary is there, certainly, but not the inimitably grand. Vanity,
      eccentricity, fancy, have created "Don Juan," not the heart; and we should
      have preferred being called upon to admire the highest capabilities of
      music in one of his oratorios or solemn church compositions than in his
      "Don Juan."<a href="#linknote38-43" name="linknoteref38-43"

      The extraordinary success of the opera<a href="#linknote38-44"

      notice of it<a href="#linknote38-45" name="linknoteref38-45"
      id="linknoteref38-45"> 45 </a> which proceeds to prove that this musical
      drama satisfies the eye, enchants the ear, does violence to the intellect,
      offends against morals, and suffers vice to trample upon virtue and good
      feeling. The author of the criticism accounts for the popularity of the
      opera by the quality of the music, which is beyond all expression grand:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever a nation might be proud of one of its children, Germany may be
      proud of Mozart, the composer of this opera. Never was the greatness of
      the human mind more perceptible, never did music reach so high a level!
      Melodies which an angel might have conceived are accompanied by divinest
      harmonies, and those whose souls are in any degree susceptible to what is
      truly beautiful will agree with me in saying the ear is bewitched.

      The pleasure of seeing a genius strike out a new path with ease, which one
      feels would possess insurmountable obstacles to others, becomes pain and
      grief, which can only be turned to enjoyment again by minute study of the
      work, when such an artist puts forth his whole strength as Mozart has in
      "Don Juan," where he overwhelms his hearers with the vastness of his art,
      giving to the whole an almost boundless effect.

      His promise of a more minute description remained unfulfilled. The various

      The popularity of the opera with the general public spread rapidly, and
      very soon there was no stage in Germany where "Don Juan" had not acquired
      permanent possession. According to Sonnleithner's calculation, "Don
      Giovanni" had been performed 531 times at Vienna at the end of the year
      1863; at Prague, Stiepanek asserts that 116 representations took place
      during the first ten years, and 360 before 1855;<a href="#linknote38-51"

      instance was the masque terzet, where the words "Courage, vigilance,

      by three gendarmes. Kalkbrenner also interpolated some of his own music,

      While "Don Giovanni" was thus becoming familiar to opera-goers in the
      north, and even in Petersburg, Stockholm, and Copenhagen, it had not met
      with any very warm or general sympathy in Italy, where repeated attempts
      to introduce it to the public had resulted only in a certain amount of
      respectful recognition from connoisseurs. "Don Giovanni" was first given
      in Rome in 1811, no pains having been spared in the rehearsals, and few
      alterations made in the opera. The audience was very attentive, and
      applauded loudly; the music was termed "bellissima, superba, sublime, un
      musicone"&mdash;but not altogether "del gusto del paese"; the many <i>stranezze</i>
      might be "belissime," but they were not what people were accustomed to.<a
      href="#linknote38-61" name="linknoteref38-61" id="linknoteref38-61"> 61
      </a> A more successful attempt was made in Naples in the following year,
      although not on so grand a scale; the audience were attentive, and seemed
      to accustom themselves to the <i>musica classica</i>, but even here the
      success was not lasting.<a href="#linknote38-62" name="linknoteref38-62"

      everything went wrong; Garcia, who was playing Don Giovanni, exerted
      himself in vain to keep the singers and orchestra in time and tune, until
      at last, sword in hand, he came forward and, commanding silence, exclaimed
      that it was a shame so to murder a masterpiece. They began again,

      id="linknoteref38-83"> 83 </a> The plot is briefly as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      First Day [The scene is laid in Naples].&mdash;The Duchess Isabella is
      having a parting interview with her lover, Duke Ottavio, when she
      discovers that Don Juan has stolen into her apartment in Ottavio's stead.
      Her cries for assistance bring the King, who gives Don Juan into the
      custody of his uncle, Don Pedro Tenorio, the Spanish <span class="side">TIRSO
      DE MOLINA'S "CONVIDADO DE PIEDRA."</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p147.png">[147]</a></span> Ambassador; the latter,
      discovering his relationship with his prisoner, allows him to escape, and
      denounces Don Ottavio to the King as Isabella's seducer. Don Pedro is
      thereupon commanded to arrest Don Ottavio, to whom, however, he declares
      that a man having been found with Isabella, she reported him to be
      Ottavio; the lover believes himself to be deceived and betrayed, and Don
      Pedro connives at his escape. [Coast scene in Tarragona.] Catalinon, Don
      Juan's servant, bears his shipwrecked master lifeless to shore, where they
      are discovered by Tisbea, a fisher-girl; Don Juan awakes to consciousness
      upon her bosom, and they fall violently in love with each other.<a
      href="#linknote38-84" name="linknoteref38-84" id="linknoteref38-84"> 84
      </a> Their love-making is interrupted by a scene in which the Commandant,
      Don Gonzalo de Ulloa gives Don Albeso, King of Castile, an account of his
      diplomatic mission to Portugal. Then the story returns to Tisbea, who is
      deceived and deserted by Don Juan, and left to her passion of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Day [The scene is in Seville].&mdash;Don Diego Tenorio, Don Juan's
      old father, acquaints the King with the crime which his son has committed
      in Naples against Isabella and Ottavio; the King banishes Don Juan from
      Seville until he shall make reparation by marrying Isabella. Ottavio
      enters and puts himself under the protection of the King, who promises to
      demonstrate his innocence in Naples, and to give him the hand of Donna
      Anna, Ulloa's daughter, and Don Juan's fiancée. Don Juan appears, greets
      Ottavio in friendly fashion, and enters into a long conversation with the
      Marquis de la Mota, wherein they discuss the beauties of the day like the
      regular roués they are; finally the Marquis declares his love for Donna
      Anna. He has no sooner departed than a note is brought to Don Juan to be
      conveyed to the Marquis; he opens it, and finding that in it Donna Anna
      appoints an interview, determines to keep the appointment himself; and he
      acquaints De la Mota, who returns, with the invitation, but names a later
      hour. He is as indifferent to his father's sentence of banishment as to
      his repeated exhortations, and upon the arrival of the Marquis to serenade
      Donna Anna, he borrows his mantle, ostensibly to enable him to visit one
      of his many sweethearts, but really that he may gain access to Donna Anna
      herself. Discovering the deceit, she cries for help; her father stops Don
      Juan's way with drawn sword, and falls by his hand. The murderer flies; De
      la Mota enters for the rendezvous; the King, hurrying in with his guards,
      takes him for the murderer, and delivers him to judgment, commanding a
      magnificent funeral for the Commandant, and the erection of a monument in
      his honour. [Country scene.] Patricio is celebrating his wedding with
      Aminta, when Don Juan, journeying through, mingles with the guests, and
      placing himself close to the bride, excites the jealousy of the
      bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third Day.&mdash;Don Juan prevails upon the jealous Patricio to renounce
      <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p148.png">[148]</a></span> Aminta by falsely representing
      that she was formerly seduced by him, and had summoned him to interrupt
      the wedding; he gains the consent of her father by means of a solemn
      promise of marriage, and after a long resistance, Aminta gives way. [The
      Sea-coast.] Isabella, arriving at the King's summons for her espousals
      with Don Juan, falls in with Tisbea, who complains of Don Juan's
      treachery, and repairs with Isabella to Seville to seek justice from the
      King. [Seville.] Don Juan, informed by Catalinon of how his victims are
      united to revenge themselves on him, sees the statue erected to the
      Commandant, with an inscription calling for vengeance on his murderer.
      This rouses his haughty insolence; he plucks the statue by the beard, and
      invites it to supper, that it may execute his vengeance. While Don Juan is
      entertaining his followers at table, the statue appears, to the
      consternation of all but Don Juan, and remains silent until the meal is
      over. Left alone with Don Juan, the Commandant invites him to supper in
      the chapel, and he accepts the invitation, after repressing an involuntary
      shudder. [The Palace.] The King promises Don Diego that he will create Don
      Juan Count of Lebrija, and bestow Isabella upon him, at the same time
      pardoning the Marquis at Donna Anna's request, and uniting the two in
      marriage. Don Ottavio requests the King's permission to fight a duel with
      Don Juan, his father proposing to judge between the two; the King commands
      a reconciliation. As he goes out, Aminta enters with her father, to
      acquaint the King with her claims on Don Juan's hand, and Ottavio promises
      her his support. [The Street.] Don Juan, pardoned by the King, and on the
      point of wedding Isabella, prepares to keep his appointment with the
      Commandant, and enters the church where Ulloa has spread a meal for him
      and Catalinon. The dishes contain scorpions and snakes, the wine is gall
      and verjuice, and the table music is a penitential psalm. After the meal,
      the Commandant grasps Don Juan's hand with a grip which cannot be shaken
      off;<a href="#linknote38-85" name="linknoteref38-85" id="linknoteref38-85">
      85 </a> "Thou art summoned to the eternal judgment-seat" exclaims the
      Commandant; "thy reward shall be fitted to thy deserts." Don Juan falls
      down lifeless and sinks below with the statue. [The Palace.] The King
      wishing to see the nuptials celebrated, Isabella, Aminta, and Tisbea come
      forward to make good their claims to Don Juan's hand, and the Marquis
      reveals the treachery practised on him by Don Juan. The King is in the act
      of promising justice, when Catalinon enters and makes known Don Juan's
      dreadful end. Thereupon Ottavio and Isabella, De la Mota and Donna Anna,
      Patricio and Aminta, are severally united, and "the story of the Marble
      Guest comes to an end."

      The drama, necessarily, in this rapid sketch, stripped of all the elegance
      and brilliancy of its poetical rendering, bears to an extraordinary degree
      the stamp of the time and nation to which it belongs. The freedom and
      unreserve with which the various love intrigues are treated and described
      are certainly peculiar to the age, and the story is distinguished by a
      dash of chivalric bravery all its own; the audience, while recognising a
      faithful representation of their own state of morals, were little inclined
      to take umbrage at the summary punishment of the sinner before them.<a
      href="#linknote38-86" name="linknoteref38-86" id="linknoteref38-86"> 86
      </a> This point is, indeed, emphasised by various observations made in a
      truly catholic spirit; for instance, when Don Juan says to his stony
      guest, after having mockingly invited him to sup: "What will'st thou,
      vision, ghost? Dost thou suffer still the pains of purgatory? Dost thou
      demand satisfaction? What is thy will? I pledge my word to do as thou
      com-mandest. Why hast thou left God's throne? Do thy sins cause thee still
      to wander?" The effect is greatly heightened again by the reply of the
      statue when Don Juan is about to light him out: "Let be; God lights my
      path." And when Don Juan sees that all is over, he begs for a confessor,
      and the statue answers, "Too late, too late is thy contrition!" and Don
      Juan falls dead. The intricate plot is very unequally treated, and so
      indeed are also the characters. Among the female characters, Tisbea as a
      type of passion, and Aminta as a type of naïve simplicity, are both
      attractive and original; and among the men Don Juan, boldly and freely
      sketched, and his servant Catalinon, the inevitable "Gracioso" of the
      Spanish drama, are most remarkable. Catalinon in particular is treated
      with moderation and delicacy; neither his cowardice, his moralising, nor
      his wit is brought too prominently forward, and he always appears as the
      shadow of his master. Even in the spectre scenes he fails to rise to any
      grandeur of character. The influence of Spain upon the Italian drama<a
      href="#linknote38-87" name="linknoteref38-87" id="linknoteref38-87"> 87
      </a> necessarily <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p150.png">[150]</a></span> brought
      Tirso's "Don Juan" to Italy. According to Ricco-boni, it first appeared
      upon an Italian stage soon after 1620.<a href="#linknote38-88"
      name="linknoteref38-88" id="linknoteref38-88"> 88 </a> The first printed
      translation known is that by Onofrio Giliberti, entitled "ü Convitato di
      Pietra," performed in 1652 at Naples; others followed with the same title
      by Giacinto Andrea Cicognini (1670) and Andrea Perucci (1678);<a
      href="#linknote38-89" name="linknoteref38-89" id="linknoteref38-89"> 89
      </a> the subject was familiar on the Italian stage, and unfailingly
      popular.<a href="#linknote38-90" name="linknoteref38-90"
      id="linknoteref38-90"> 90 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian dramatic company, who were naturalised in Paris at the theatre
      of the Hötel de Bourgogne, were accustomed to appoint one of their number
      to arrange the plan of the pieces which they performed, but the actual
      performance was improvised. In this fashion they played an improvised
      version of Giliberti's "Convitato di Pietra," which had an extraordinary
      run.<a href="#linknote38-91" name="linknoteref38-91" id="linknoteref38-91">
      91 </a> The chief situations of the Spanish drama, much simplified and
      coarsened, are compressed into five acts, and Arlecchino, who appears here
      as Don Juan's servant, is brought into the foreground and made the
      mouthpiece of a great deal of very questionable badinage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act represents Isabella's seduction in Naples. Don Pedro, her
      father and Don Juan's uncle, agrees with her to denounce Ottavio, her
      lover, as her seducer, which causes the latter to take flight.<a
      href="#linknote38-92" name="linknoteref38-92" id="linknoteref38-92"> 92
      </a> In the second act Don Juan and Arlecchino swim to shore [a very
      favourite scene, richly garnished with jokes], and Don Juan's love
      passages with the lovely fisher-maiden Rosalba take place. On her claiming
      his promise of marriage, he mockingly refers her to Arlecchino, who
      unrolls the long list of his master's mistresses. It was customary to
      allow the end of the roll to fall, as if by chance, into the pit, and the
      audience delighted themselves by looking for the names of their friends or
      connections in the list. Rosalba, in despair, casts herself into the sea.<a
      href="#linknote38-93" name="linknoteref38-93" id="linknoteref38-93"> 93

      <span class="side">THE ITALIAN "CONVITATO DI PIETRA."</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p151.png">[151]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The third act shows Ottavio in great favour at the court of Castile, on
      the point of marriage with Donna Anna. He is attended by Pantaloon, who
      carries on the usual by-play with Arlecchino. Don Juan intercepts the
      letter in which Donna Anna summons Ottavio, steals in to her, Arlecchino
      keeping watch outside, and slays the Commandant, her father, who surprises
      them. In the fourth act Donna Anna demands justice from the King; a reward
      of 6,000 thalers is placed upon the head of the murderer, and Arlecchino
      is greatly tempted to gain it, which gives rise to much jesting between
      him and Pantaloon. In the fifth act Don Juan is discovered before the
      statue of the Commandant, which he mocks. Arlecchino is made to invite it
      to supper, whereupon it nods, and, upon Don Juan's repetition of the
      invitation, answers him in words. Don Juan's supper gives opportunity for
      much comic display of greediness and cunning on the part of Arlecchino,
      continuing even after the appearance of the Commandant, who invites Don
      Juan and departs. The King, made acquainted with Don Juan's crimes,
      commands him to be seized and brought to justice. Before escaping he keeps

      Molière did not neglect so promising a subject for the use of his company,
      and his "Don Juan, ou le Festin de Pierre" was first performed at the
      Palais-Royal on February 15, 1665. In contrast with the buffoonery of the
      Italians he has tried to raise the subject into the sphere of genuine
      comedy, and has thereby obliterated the last trace of the
      national-historical character of the drama in its Spanish form. Both
      sensual passion and chivalric boldness have disappeared. Molière's "Don
      Juan" is a cold-blooded egotist in his love and his want of faith, an
      enlightened rationalist, even when preserving his honour as a cavalier
      with personal bravery; his servant Sganarelle reasons as morally as his
      master immorally, but is quite as great an egotist, and a coward into the
      bargain. The striking situations, in which the original was so rich, are
      either merely related, as in the case of the seduction of Donna Anna and
      the murder of the Commenda-tore, or they have lost all their lively
      colouring by a new turn, as in the case of the adventures with the
      fisher-girl and the peasant; everything that might shock or injure the
      <span class="side">MOLIÈRE'S "FESTIN DE PIERRE."</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p153.png">[153]</a></span> refined tone
      of comedy was omitted. On the other hand, the interests of morality
      required that every opportunity for repentance and amendment should be
      given to Don Juan; the more he is preached at from every quarter, the more
      obstinate he becomes in his evil courses. The truthfulness of
      psychological development thus striven after makes the catastrophe all the
      more glaringly absurd; such a sinner as this could not be carried off by a
      ghost. As a compromise, Molière makes Don Juan to be warned by a spirit in
      the form of a woman, who is transformed into an appearance of Time with
      his scythe; this was an allegory quite after the taste of the time, and
      rendered the marble guest a superfluity. Some of the situations, such as
      the adventure in the country, or the scene with the merchant, are
      excellently rendered, and delicate traits of characterisation are always
      to be found; in fact, the better a point is, the less it is found to have
      to do with the original "Don Juan." Molière's "Don Juan" was not printed
      during his life, and was only played fifteen times. A versified adaptation
      of it by Thomas Corneille, given in 1677, was well received, and kept the
      stage until 1847, when Molière's comedy was again substituted.<a

      Incited by Molière's example, Goldoni produced the "mauvaise pièce
      espagnole," which he could not contemplate without horror, at Venice in
      1736, in the worthier form of a regular comedy entitled "Don Giovanni
      Tenorio, ossia il Dissoluto":&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first act, Donna Anna obeys her father against her will, and is
      betrothed to Don Ottavio. The second act shows Elisa, a peasant girl,
      taking leave of her lover Carino. Immediately after Don Juan appears,
      plundered by robbers, and gains her favour. Carino surprises them bidding
      farewell, but Elisa appeases his jealousy. Isabella, who has been deserted
      by Don Juan in Naples, follows him disguised as a man. In the third act
      she enters Seville with Ottavio, whom she has delivered from the hands of
      robbers on the way hither. When Donna Anna discovers her sex, she makes it
      the excuse for renouncing Ottavio's hand. Isabella, meeting Don Juan,
      forces him to fight with her; but, refusing from shame to give the
      standers-by any account of herself, she is pronounced by Don Juan to be a
      maniac. Elisa also <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p154.png">[154]</a></span> pursues Don
      Juan, but he is warned against her by Carino, to whom she has been
      faithless. Don Juan declares himself ready to give her up, but Carino will
      have none of her. In the fourth act, Don Juan makes declaration of love to
      Donna Anna, who is not unfavourably disposed towards him, but refers him
      to her father for consent. He seeks, however, with drawn sword to gain her
      favour on the spot; she calls for help; her father hastens in, and is
      slain by Don Juan, who then escapes. It is resolved to pursue him and to
      seek redress against him from the King. In the fifth act Elisa promises to
      liberate him, having relatives among the guards, if he will marry her.
      Isabella interposes and renews her challenge to him to fight. Donna Anna,
      in mourning robes, calls for vengeance, but Don Juan displays so much
      passion for her that she relents and pardons him. Thereupon comes a letter
      from the King of Naples, demanding Don Juan's punishment, and disclosing
      Isabella's secret. Don Juan, seeing himself hopelessly lost, beseeches
      Carino to slay him. A thunderbolt from the mausoleum of the murdered
      Commendatore strikes him dead.

      Goldoni asserts<a href="#linknote38-101" name="linknoteref38-101"
      id="linknoteref38-101"> 101 </a> that the public were astonished at first,
      and did not know "Ce que voulait dire cet air de noblesse que l'auteur
      avait donné à une ancienne bouffonnerie." But it soon became known that
      the coquettish Elisa was an actual portrait of the actress, Elizabeth
      Passalacqua, who played the part, and that Goldoni had chosen this way of
      being revenged on her for bestowing her favours simultaneously on him and
      on the actor Vitalba. This roused interest in the piece, and convinced
      people "que le comique raisonné était préférable au comique trivial."
      Rosimond looked at the subject from quite another point of view in his <i>tragi-comédie</i>
      "Le Festin de Pierre, ou l'Athéiste Foudroyé," produced in 1669 at the
      Théätre du Marais. This theatre was then noted for its brilliant
      decoration and spectacle pieces, which often necessitated high prices of
      admission. Such a piece was this of Rosimond's, and he had been careful to
      lay the plot in heathen times, that his atheism might vaunt itself with
      impunity.<a href="#linknote38-102" name="linknoteref38-102"
      id="linknoteref38-102"> 102 </a> Again, in 1746, "Le Grand Festin de

      In England also "Don Juan" was put on the stage at about the same time.
      Whether in his "Libertine Destroyed," which was produced in 1676, Thomas
      Shadwell followed the Spanish original or the French or Italian version, I
      cannot pretend to determine. The piece was very successful, but Don Juan's
      villainy was so dreadful, and the piece altogether so horrible, "as to
      render it little less than impiety to represent it on the stage."<a
      href="#linknote38-104" name="linknoteref38-104" id="linknoteref38-104">
      104 </a> In 1725 Antonio de Zamora, Chamberlain to King Philip V. of
      Spain, adapted the same subject under the title, "Non hay deuda que no se
      pague y convi-dado de piedra." "This adaptation, displaying much talent
      and skill, is cast almost in the same form as the opera; the earlier
      adventures of Don Juan in Naples are omitted, and Zamora, like the author
      of the libretto, begins with the murder of the Commandant."<a

      the standing repertory of the improvising actor from the beginning of the
      eighteenth century. Prehauser, the celebrated buffoon of the Vienna

      It was in Paris that the first attempt was made to treat "Don Juan"
      operatically. In the year 1713, Le Tellier produced "au jeu d'Octave," a
      comic opera "Le Festin de Pierre," in three acts, and "en vaudevilles sans

      In the first division, Don Juan serenades his mistress, Donna Anna, and is
      admitted by her; surprised by her uncle, he escapes into the street, and
      slays his pursuer. In the second division, Don Juan is giving a feast, at
      which Donna Anna is present, and dances, a <i>pas de deux</i> with him;
      the appearance of the statue scares away the guests. After a short stay,
      the Commendatore invites Don Juan, who accepts, and conducts him to the
      door. In the meantime the guests reassemble, but seized with fresh terror,
      rush from the house; Don Juan prepares to seek the Commendatore alone, his
      servant, spite of threats and persuasions, refusing to accompany him. The
      third part takes place in the mausoleum; the Commendatore tries vainly to
      bring Don Juan to repentance, and finally plunges him into the abyss. In
      the last division, Don Juan is tormented by demons in the lower world; he
      strives in vain to escape or to resist, and at last, in despair, he
      resigns himself and is devoured by the flames.<a href="#linknote38-117"

      The fisher maiden Elisa, and her lover Ombrino, save Don Giovanni and his
      servant Arlechino from the waves. Don Giovanni, who has betrayed Isabella,
      daughter of the Duca d'Altamonte, in Naples, and is a fugitive in
      consequence, readily wins the love of the too-confiding Elisa. The
      Commendatore di Loioa, returning from victorious war, is greeted by Don
      Alfonso in the name of the King of Castile, who has erected a statue to
      his honour, and promises to wed his daughter Donna Anna to the Duca
      Ottavio. Donna Anna, in defiance of her father's threats, refuses the
      honour. Don Giovanni, whose crime and flight have been made known to Don
      Alfonso, enters with Arlechino the house of the Commendatore, where Donna
      Anna, having dismissed her maid Lisette, is preparing to retire to rest.
      He offers her violence, which she resists, and recognises him; thereupon
      enters the Commendatore and falls in <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p158.png">[158]</a></span> combat
      with Don Giovanni. Donna Anna vows vengeance on the murderer. In the
      second act Don Giovanni determines to flee, and orders Arlechino to be
      ready in the tavern, and to order a meal. Isabella, who has pursued Don
      Giovanni, extorts from Don Alfonso a promise of reparation. Don Giovanni,
      seized with remorse, takes refuge in the mausoleum, and falls asleep near
      the statue of the Commendatore. There he is found by the sorrowing Anna,
      whose love and pity he seeks in vain to kindle. Arlechino summons him to
      the tavern, where all is prepared; he invites the statue to be his guest,
      and is sorely perplexed by the answer given. Arlechino in the tavern makes
      love to the hostess Corallina. Donna Anna receives from Don Alfonso the
      assurance of the speedy pursuit and punishment of Don Giovanni. The latter
      sups with Arlechino, waited upon by Corallina and Tiburzio; he toasts the
      approving audience, Arlechino and the pretty maids, in German verse! The
      statue appears, but does not eat, invites Don Giovanni and disappears; the
      meal is continued with the utmost composure. In the third act, Don
      Giovanni is the guest of the Commendatore in the mausoleum; he refuses to
      repent, and is cast into the abyss. Don Alfonso and Donna Anna are
      acquainted by Arlechino of this consummation. Don Giovanni is seen
      tormented by demons.

      on it, but rejects his exhortation to repentance, and is delivered over to
      the demons.<a href="#linknote38-129" name="linknoteref38-129"

      A wealth of material, which made the task of selection difficult, left Da

      his previous studies,<a href="#linknote38-132" name="linknoteref38-132"
      id="linknoteref38-132"> 132 </a> but even compared with Gazzaniga's
      libretto, which he closely followed for the greater part of the first act
      and the second finale, we cannot fail to recognise his superiority in the
      arrangement of the plot, in the delineation of character, and in the
      grouping of situations for musical treatment, especially in the ensembles.
      His discrimination in the selection of material was also very just. He saw
      clearly that if the spectral apparition was to have its due effect it must
      be set in vivid contrast with the representation of actual life, with all
      its impulses of passion, of love, hate, or despair, of humour and
      merriment. He cannot be said to have cast the magic of true poetry over
      his work, nor has it the knightly tone of the Spanish original, but he has
      endowed <span class="side">DA PONTE'S LIBRETTO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p161.png">[161]</a></span> his
      characters with the easy pleasure-loving spirit of the time; and the
      sensual frivolity of life at Venice or Vienna is mirrored in every page of
      his "Don Giovanni." The language displays a versatility almost amounting
      to gracefulness; and, remembering to what a low level of vulgarity the
      treatment of the subject had been brought, we shall be the more ready to
      recognise the effort to raise the dialogue to a more sensible and refined
      standard. Da Ponte was right in placing the main points on which the
      action turns upon the stage, and in furnishing the composer with a number
      of musically effective situations, in which the elements of tragedy and
      comedy, of horror and merriment, meet and mingle together. This curious
      intermixture of ground-tones, which seldom allows; expression to any one
      pure and unalloyed mood, is the special characteristic of the opera.
      Mozart grasped the unity of these contrasts lying deep in human nature,
      and expressed them so harmoniously as to open a new province to his art,
      for the development of which its mightiest forces were henceforward to be
      concentrated. Great as has been the progress of music in the expression of
      this inner life of man since Mozart's time, he has not yet been surpassed
      in his power of creating living forms instinct with artistic beauty, and
      endowed with perfect dramatic truth. When Goethe declared that Mozart
      would have been the man to compose his "Faust,"<a href="#linknote38-133"
      name="linknoteref38-133" id="linknoteref38-133"> 133 </a> he was thinking
      of "Don Giovanni"; but it could scarcely have been the merely external
      manipulation of the plot, however skilful, which directed his opinion.
      With the instinctive certainty of genius he felt the universality of
      Mozart's conception and representation of humanity, and acknowledged him
      as his equal on what was, in his judgment, a far more extensive field than
      this.

      The commencement of the opera<a href="#linknote38-134"
      name="linknoteref38-134" id="linknoteref38-134"> 134 </a> sets us at once
      in the midst of the action: the passionate intensity of the first <span
      class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p162.png">[162]</a></span> scene, the villainy which is
      practised before our eyes, prepare us for the deep shadow which is to fall
      on the picture of reckless pleasure-seeking, and for its horrifying
      conclusion; nor is the humorous element altogether absent:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Leporello is discovered keeping impatient watch for his master, who soon
      appears, pursued by Donna Anna, and vainly striving to break loose from
      her. Her cries for help bring the Commendatore, her father, who challenges
      the insolent intruder to fight, and falls by Don Giovanni's sword, to the
      consternation of the latter and of Leporello. Neither scorn nor mockery
      are expressed in the words, "Ah! gia cade il sciagurato," and the music is
      as far from such sentiments as the words. Da Ponte has sagaciously shown
      traits of natural human sentiment in Don Giovanni, and Mozart has not let
      these escape him. But he has no time to waste in regrets; he takes to
      flight, and immediately after Donna Anna returns with her affianced lover,
      Don Ottavio; she swoons at sight of the corpse, and as soon as she returns
      to herself makes Don Ottavio swear vengeance on the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Giovanni, deaf to Leporello's reproaches, is confiding to him that he
      is in pursuit of a new adventure,<a href="#linknote38-135"
      name="linknoteref38-135" id="linknoteref38-135"> 135 </a> when a lady
      enters. This is Donna Elvira, whom he has deceived and deserted in Burgos,
      and who has followed him to claim his promise of marriage; he approaches
      her, and is consternated on seeing who she is. She overwhelms him with
      reproaches, and he refers her to Leporello for explanations and excuses,
      taking the opportunity of slipping away himself; Leporello, for her
      consolation, displays a list of his master's love intrigues, which he
      carries about with him. Enraged at this fresh insult, she resolves to
      sacrifice her love for her unfaithful lover to her thirst for vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Masetto and Zerlina, with their village friends, are celebrating their
      wedding in the neighbourhood of Don Giovanni's casino, whither he has
      repaired by preconcerted arrangement. Zerlina's fresh loveliness attracts
      him; and, making acquaintance with the bridal party, he invites them all
      into his casino, but soon drives out Masetto, whose jealousy he has
      excited; and is on the point of winning Zerlina by his flattery and
      declarations of love when Elvira steps between them, warns Zerlina, and
      (spite of Don Giovanni's whispered protestation that she is a poor maniac
      in love with him and mad with jealousy) carries off the peasant maiden.<a
      href="#linknote38-136" name="linknoteref38-136" id="linknoteref38-136">
      136 </a> To Don Giovanni, thus left alone, enter Donna Anna and Ottavio,
      who greet him as a friend of the family, and claim his <span class="side">DA
      PONTE'S LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p163.png">[163]</a></span>
      assistance in discovering the murderer and bringing him to justice; while
      he is conversing with Donna Anna, Elvira again interposes and warns her
      that he is a hypocrite. He again secretly represents her as a maniac who
      must be humoured,<a href="#linknote38-137" name="linknoteref38-137"
      id="linknoteref38-137"> 137 </a> and goes out with her. Donna Anna's
      suspicions are aroused, and observing Don Giovanni closely, she recognises
      her father's murderer in him, acquaints Don Ottavio with the
      circumstances, and urges him to avenge her father's death. Unwilling to
      give easy credence to such a grave accusation, he decides to examine
      thoroughly into the affair, and to clear up the doubts as to Don Giovanni.
      The latter, disembarrassed of Donna Elvira, commands a banquet to be
      prepared in honour of the bridal party. Masetto, whom Zerlina has with
      difficulty appeased by her coaxing endearments, conceals himself when he
      sees Don Giovanni approaching; after some demure behaviour on Zerlina's
      part, Masetto comes forward, and Don Giovanni, with quick presence of
      mind, persuades them both to accompany him into the house for the banquet.
      Donna Anna and Don Ottavio enter with Elvira, who has explained everything
      to them, and at her instigation they all put on masks, in order to observe
      Don Giovanni without being recognised; Leporello, perceiving them, conveys
      the expected invitation to enter, which they accept. It was at that time
      customary in Venice to go about masked, and strangers thus disguised were
      invited to enter where any festivities were going on, thus heightening the
      frolic of the masquerade. As they enter the hall, there is a pause in the
      dance; the guests take refreshment, Don Giovanni devotes himself to
      Zerlina, and Masetto, his jealousy again aroused, seeks to warn her; then
      the masked strangers become the centre of observation, are politely
      greeted, and the dance begins again. Donna Anna and Don Ottavio tread a
      minuet, the dance of the aristocracy;<a href="#linknote38-138"
      name="linknoteref38-138" id="linknoteref38-138"> 138 </a> Donna Anna with
      difficulty restrains her conflicting emotions, which vent themselves in
      occasional interjections, while Don Ottavio exhorts her to remain calm.
      Elvira follows every movement of Don Giovanni; the latter invites Zerlina
      to dance, and Leporello forces Masetto to dance with him in order to
      distract his attention from Zerlina. At the right moment Don Giovanni
      carries off Zerlina. Leporello hurries after to warn him; her cries for
      help are heard, and all rush to her rescue. Don Giovanni meets them,
      dragging in Leporello, whom he gives out to be the culprit, and threatens
      with death; but he is surrounded on all sides, the masks are thrown off,
      and he finds himself in the midst of his victims, <span class="side">DON
      GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p164.png">[164]</a></span>
      intent on revenge. For one moment his presence of mind forsakes him and he
      is at a loss how to extricate himself, but his courage speedily returns,
      and he boldly and irresistibly makes his way through his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This momentary dismay and confusion is psychologically correct, and brings
      an important feature into the situation, which Mozart has effectively
      seized in his musical characterisation of it. Don Giovanni and Leporello,
      with the storm of voices surging round them, sing <i>sotto voce</i>; and
      highly characteristic is the submission to Leporello's opinion to which
      Don Giovanni here condescends. Only with the words "Ma non manca in me
      corraggio" does he gather his senses together, and strike at once a
      different key, in which Leporello cannot follow him.<a
      href="#linknote38-139" name="linknoteref38-139" id="linknoteref38-139">
      139 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act must be allowed to have a well-constructed and interesting
      plot, but the second consists of situations without cohesion or
      connection, although capable of being made musically very effective. It
      wants a leading motive to hold the parts together, the incessant pursuit
      of Don Giovanni not by any means answering the purpose; the comic tone
      also degenerates into coarseness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Giovanni, having appeased the incensed Leporello with money and fair
      words, confides to him that he is courting Elvira's pretty wait-ing-maid,
      and changes clothes with him in order to gain easier access to her. This
      is scarcely accomplished when Elvira appears at the window. In order to
      get out of the affair with a good grace, Don Giovanni renews his addresses
      to her with pretended passion, and she is weak enough to give ear to him.
      Leporello, in his disguise, accepts and answers her protestations of love,
      until Don Giovanni, making a noisy entrance, drives them both away; then
      with a tender song he strives to entice the waiting-maid to appear.
      Masetto then enters armed, with several friends, to call Don Giovanni to
      account; the supposed Leporello undertakes to put them on the right track,
      but cleverly contrives to disperse and dismiss them, wheedles Masetto out
      of his weapons, beats him soundly, and escapes. Masetto's cries bring
      Zerlina to the spot, and she seeks to console him with loving caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Leporello and Elvira have taken refuge in an antechamber;
      Leporello tries to slip away, while Elvira beseeches him not to leave her
      alone in the dark. He is on the point of escaping when <span class="side">DA
      PONTE'S LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p165.png">[165]</a></span>
      Don Ottavio enters with Donna Anna, endeavouring to calm her sorrow;
      Elvira and Leporello each try to escape unobserved, but Zerlina and
      Masetto intercept them. The supposed Don Giovanni is taken to account on
      the spot; in vain does Elvira petition for him, to the general
      astonishment; at last Leporello discovers himself, and after many excuses
      and explanations makes good his escape. Don Ottavio, now no longer
      doubting that Don Giovanni is the murderer of the Com-mendatore, announces
      his intention of proceeding against him in a court of justice, and begs
      his friends to console his betrothed until he shall have accomplished his
      design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Giovanni awaits Leporello's arrival at the foot of the monument
      erected to the Commendatore, and laughingly relates his latest adventure;
      an invisible voice twice utters words of warning. He becomes aware of the
      presence of the statue, and makes Leporello read the inscription on it: "I
      here await the chastisement of my ruthless murderer." In arrogant contempt
      of Leporello's horror he forces the latter to invite the statue to supper;
      the statue nodding its head. Don Giovanni calls upon it to answer, and on
      its distinctly uttering the word "Yes" he hastens away in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Ottavio strives anew to console Donna Anna, and at last begs for her
      hand in marriage: she explains that, though her heart consents to his
      prayer, her mourning for her father compels her to postpone its
      fulfilment. This scene gives rise to a suspicion of having been inserted
      in Prague after the completion of the opera, in order to give the singer a
      final air. The situation is repeated at the close of the finale, and is
      not here in accordance with Don Ottavio's previous appearances. Don
      Giovanni, seated at his richly appointed table, eats and jokes with the
      greedy Leporello. This scene, which was always made the occasion for broad
      jesting between master and servant, has been turned by Mozart into musical
      fun and by-play. Don Giovanni's private musicians play favourite airs from
      the newest operas. At the first bar Leporello cries "Bravi! 'Cosa Rara!'"
      It is the last movement of the first finale from Martin's "Cosa Rara": "O
      quanto un si bel giubilo," which was then in every one's mouth; and the
      parody was a very happy one. Just as in Martin's opera the discontented
      lovers are contrasted with the more favoured ones, on whom their
      mistresses have been bestowed before their eyes, so here the hungry
      Leporello contrasts with the gormandising Don Giovanni, and the music
      might have been made for them. The second piece is greeted by Leporello
      with "Evvivano! 'I Litiganti!'" It is Mingone's favourite air from Sarti's
      opera, "Fra Due Litiganti il Terzo gode" (Act I., 8), the same on which
      Mozart had written variations (Vol. II., p. 345), the then familiar words
      of which&mdash;

      140 </a> The apparent malice which induced Mozart to parody favourite
      pieces from operas which were avowedly rivals of his own (the impression
      being immensely heightened by the humorous instrumentation caricaturing
      arrangements for harmony music), is rendered in some degree excusable by
      his having included himself in the joke. When the musicians strike up "Non
      più andrai," Leporello exclaims: "Questa poi la conosco pur troppo!" Thus
      Mozart expressed his gratitude to the people of Prague for their
      enthusiastic reception of "Figaro."<a href="#linknote38-141"

      To this merry pair enters Elvira. She has overcome her love, and intends
      entering a cloister, but wishes to make one more effort to bring Don
      Giovanni to repentance; but her representation being met only with easy
      contempt, she angrily leaves him. She is heard to utter a shriek without.
      Leporello hastens after her, and returns in horror: the statue of the
      Commendatore is at the door; it knocks, and Don Giovanni has to go himself
      to open it, and to conduct his marble guest to a seat. The statue rejects
      all hospitality, and asks Don Giovanni if he is prepared to return the
      visit; on his answering in the affirmative, he grasps him by the hand, and
      calls upon him to repent. Don Giovanni repeatedly and defiantly refuses,
      and the statue leaves him; night comes on, flames burst from the earth,
      invisible spirit voices are heard, demons surround Don Giovanni, who sinks
      into the abyss. Don Ottavio and Donna Anna, Elvira, Masetto and Zerlina
      enter to drag the offender to justice, but find that human revenge has
      been anticipated; Leporello, who has witnessed the dreadful scene with
      every sign of horror, relates his master's fearful end. Relieved from
      anxiety, and restored to their natural relations, they unite in the words
      of the "old song"&mdash;

    <p>
      No doubt the serious moral appended to the gay and easygoing tone of the
      opera was a reminiscence of the custom of considering the piece, on
      account of its ready practical application, as a sort of religious drama;
      the music takes the same tone towards the end. We can scarcely conceive
      that it was with a view to the moral effect alone that Da Ponte so
      contrived the plot that Don Giovanni should fail in each <span class="side">GERMAN
      ADAPTATIONS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p167.png">[167]</a></span>
      of the love adventures in which he engages; there can be no question that
      the cheerful tone which runs through the whole opera depends chiefly on
      the repulses with which the hero is continually met on the field of his
      heroic deeds. It is true that some of the passionate force which
      distinguishes the Spanish drama is thereby sacrificed, but, on the other
      hand, the murders and low crimes which were heaped up in the German
      burlesques of "Don Giovanni" also disappeared, and the concentration of
      the action dispensed with a number of ill-connected and licentious scenes.
      Unfortunately the German adaptations have made a concession to the popular
      taste in retaining the accustomed Carnival frolic, which has nothing
      whatever in common with Da Ponte's "Don Giovanni"&mdash;to say nothing of
      Mozart. Only of late has this deformity been occasionally removed by the
      introduction of the original recitative in its stead.<a
      href="#linknote38-142" name="linknoteref38-142" id="linknoteref38-142">
      142 </a> But, apart from this, the current German version not only misses
      the easy, often striking and graceful style of the Italian verses, and
      spoils the melodious flow of the words; it even distorts the sense, and
      puts into the mouths of the singers sentiments foreign alike to the
      situation and to the music.<a href="#linknote38-143"

      But whatever merit Da Ponte's libretto may claim, it claims chiefly as
      having given occasion to Mozart's music; (527 K.). One is accustomed to
      consider the libretto of an opera as the canvas on which the composer is
      to work <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p168.png">[168]</a></span> his embroidery; it might in this
      case almost be compared to the frame on which the sculptor erects and
      models his statue, so completely is the endowment of the opera with body
      and soul the actual and exclusive work of Mozart.<a href="#linknote38-144"
      name="linknoteref38-144" id="linknoteref38-144"> 144 </a> The very
      overture<a href="#linknote38-145" name="linknoteref38-145"
      id="linknoteref38-145"> 145 </a> shows at once that something more is to
      be expected than the usual fun of opera buffa. Mozart must have strongly
      felt the necessity for a grave and solemn introduction, and has therefore
      selected the usual French form of overture, consisting of a slow
      introduction followed by an allegro. The andante is taken from the opera
      itself. We have the principal subjects of the spectral apparition (as it
      were, the musical expression of the old title "Il Con-vitato di Pietra"),
      indicating at the very commencement the culminating point of the opera,
      and fixing its ground-tone.<a href="#linknote38-146"
      name="linknoteref38-146" id="linknoteref38-146"> 146 </a> After a few
      introductory chords, clear, solemn sounds are heard like an apparition
      from heaven, spreading around a feeling of disquiet and strangeness,
      swelling into fear and horror. It is interesting to note how the ascending
      and descending scales, which, like the mysterious rustling of the <span
      class="side">THE OVERTURE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p169.png">[169]</a></span> breeze, produce a kind of cold
      shudder in the hearer, were first brought clearly before Mozart's mind
      during the performance of the ghost scene. In the finale, where they first
      occur (p. 271), they were wanting in the original score; Mozart inserted
      them subsequently, and, room being scarce, wrote them in diminutive little
      notes, which often extend into the following bar; but the second time they
      occur, and in the overture, they are duly written down. The allegro is
      exclusively suggestive of the main features of the story; and an eager,
      irrepressible force, "which is intoxicated with the lust for enjoyment,
      and in enjoyment pines for lust," penetrates the whole, sometimes in
      accents of keen pain&mdash;[See Page Images] and hot desire, sometimes
      with exultation and wild delight.<a href="#linknote38-147"
      name="linknoteref38-147" id="linknoteref38-147"> 147 </a> The grave cry of

      and then the contrasting elements are worked out with a wealth of
      harmonious and contrapuntal detail. Mozart is said to have borrowed both

      will show what a keen hunt after plagiarism is required to find any
      borrowed idea in this imitative disposition of parts, common to many old
      church compositions. But here again Mozart has turned one of the resources
      of musical construction into a development of a psychological idea. How
      deeply suggestive it is that the warning cries should be heard woven into
      the imitations, dying into tender, almost melancholy entreaty, and
      finally, as the mocker seems determined to treat it all as a jest, rising
      into an awful call to repentance, sounding again and again with a force
      that penetrates into the very marrow of one's bones! Again, how truly
      conceived is the harmonic transition at the close, by means of which this
      warning motif cuts short with the seventh the jubilation at its very
      highest pitch, then dies away into gentle notes of remonstrance, and so
      gradually calms the hearer, and prepares him for what is to follow!<a

      The opera begins by introducing us to the only really comic character it
      contains, and thus in a measure fulfils the anticipations excited by the
      overture. The typical character of the comic servant, which in "Don Juan"
      had passed through the successive stages of Gracioso, Arlecchino,
      Sganarelle, Hanswurst, and Kasperle, here attained to perfection as far as
      opera buffa is concerned. Leporello is a creation unique of its kind; but
      since in every branch of art gifted minds, however original, draw from a
      common source, so Leporello, <span class="side">LEPORELLO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p171.png">[171]</a></span> striking as
      is his individuality, is developed out of the traditions of opera buffa.
      The distinctive character of the opera depends upon his intimate
      connection with all the situations and all the persons. It would not
      suffice for the due blending of the contrasting elements that Leporello
      should scatter jests in season and out of season on every conceivable
      topic; it was only by rendering all his acts and expressions consistent
      with his character that they could be made to react upon the situations
      and persons which brought them forth. He has a distinct personality, with
      his own way of thinking and feeling, and his own way of expressing
      himself. The boldness with which his essentially comic nature is brought
      into conflict with passions and events which sound the very depths of the
      human heart transports us to the highest province of humour. This is
      especially observable in his relations to his master, with whom he is at
      once in sympathy and in striking contrast.

      He has the same desire for enjoyment and display, the same laxity of moral
      judgment, the same tendency to treat serious matters in a mocking spirit;
      he does not want ability either, but fails altogether in just those
      qualities which keep alive our interest in Don Giovanni&mdash;in strength
      and courage: his cowardice betrays itself on every occasion. While Don
      Giovanni is on the look-out for every adventure, however daring, and
      extricates himself from every peril, however imminent, Leporello is always
      pressed into the service, is utterly helpless in any contingency, and
      escapes finally only by virtue of his cowardice. This contradiction
      between his nature and his surroundings is all the more entertaining since
      he himself is perfectly aware of it. We learn his character from the very
      first. He is in high dudgeon at being forced to mount guard outside while
      his master is enjoying himself within, and marches impatiently up and
      down; but as he marches, proud thoughts of future grandeur take possession
      of his soul. "Voglio far il gentiluomo"&mdash;he might almost be taken for
      a cavalier. Suddenly he hears a noise. He is no longer the grand
      gentleman, but gives vent to abject fear in his terrified babble, as Don
      Giovanni wrestles with Donna Anna. When the danger grows serious, and the
      Commendatore falls, he is seized with horror, but <span class="side">DON
      GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p172.png">[172]</a></span>
      although the moral shock is great it is with actual physical fear that his
      teeth chatter. The whole sequence of characteristic expression in the
      scene receives its full significance only by contrast with Leporello's
      cowardice. Donna Anna's passion, which Don Giovanni is constrained to
      oppose with a force equal to her own; the dignified bearing of the
      Commendatore, forcing Don Giovanni at length reluctantly to draw the
      sword;<a href="#linknote38-150" name="linknoteref38-150"
      id="linknoteref38-150"> 150 </a> the duel<a href="#linknote38-151"
      name="linknoteref38-151" id="linknoteref38-151"> 151 </a> with its
      horrifying result&mdash;all these afford a rapid succession of exciting
      and harrowing points, scarcely leaving room for the comic element, which
      nevertheless is there, and kept actively before us without doing injury to
      the harmony of the whole. What a force of artistic expression is displayed
      in the eighteen bars of andante which close the introduction! The death
      which ends the pain of the Commendatore, the mingled pity and triumph of
      Don Giovanni, the horror and fear of Leporello, are blended into such
      harmony as to leave the mind&mdash;relieved from suspense&mdash;full of
      true emotion. The unusual combination of three bass voices seems as though
      expressly chosen for the serious tone of the situation; the stringed
      instruments accompany the voices in the simplest manner, with a few
      sustained notes for the horns and bassoons, and only in the concluding
      symphony do the oboes and flutes enter with a plaintive chromatic passage.
      Here burns truly the inextinguishable flame of genius!<a

      To return to Leporello. The various ways in which his timorous nature
      expresses itself in different situations give occasion for the most
      interesting characterisation. He has least to do in the first finale, but
      he stands close by his master, who shields him in their common danger; in
      the <span class="side">THE SESTET&mdash;LEPORELLO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p173.png">[173]</a></span> sestet,
      however, he shows himself in his full proportions. Willing as he is to
      take his master's place with Elvira, his fears do not suffer him to do it;
      and when he finds himself alone in the dark with her, in spite of her
      entreaties not to be left alone, his one anxiety is to escape. The
      contrast is excellently expressed between the bashfulness of Elvira and
      the terror of her cowardly interlocutor. Just as he is making off, Don
      Ottavio and Donna Anna enter, and he conceals himself. A rapid transition
      to another key, emphasised by the unexpected entry of drums and trumpets,
      transports us to a higher region, and an affectingly beautiful expression
      is given to the sorrow of a noble mind and the consolation of a loving
      heart. Elvira again takes part in the situation; she is full of anxiety
      for the supposed Don Giovanni, and the expression of her fear becomes more
      material, lowering her to the level of Leporello, who seeks anew to
      escape, and repeats his former motif, but more despondently, and in the
      minor key. Then Zerlina and Masetto enter and run against him, Don Ottavio
      and Donna Anna also become aware of his presence; and, to their intense
      surprise, Elvira interposes a petition for Don Giovanni. Her former motif
      expressive of anxiety is taken up and maintained by the orchestra,
      becoming the nucleus of the situation, the surprise of the other serving
      only to give light and shade. When her petition is finally rejected,
      Leporello throws off his disguise. His timidity has become mortal fear, he
      knows that his insignificance alone can shield him, and he cannot
      reiterate too strongly that he is in very truth Leporello, and not Don
      Giovanni. The general surprise at this discovery is of course expressed in
      far stronger fashion than that at Elvira's sudden change of mind. What is
      to be done? At first they are all at a loss. With regard to Leporello,
      though he has more or less injured some of them, their position is in
      common; he is not the Don Giovanni on whom they have vowed vengeance;
      their indignant amazement at the deceit practised on them unites them into
      a compact body, more occupied with their own feelings than anxious to
      punish Leporello. The latter thinks only of the <span class="side">DON
      GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p174.png">[174]</a></span>
      danger which threatens him, and, try as he may to collect himself, fear
      gets possession of him; he mumbles to himself, cries aloud, and makes a
      final appeal for mercy before he runs away. The perplexity which seizes
      them all at the discovery of Leporello is the point of union of the
      situation; the truth and energy with which the nature of each person is
      expressed giving it the stamp of life and power.<a href="#linknote38-153"
      name="linknoteref38-153" id="linknoteref38-153"> 153 </a> Leporello's
      position is totally different when Don Giovanni arrogantly orders him to
      invite the statue of the Commendatore to sup with them (Act II., 9). The
      mysterious sounds which he has just heard, and the marble figure, terrify
      him; but his master threatens with drawn sword; one fear overmasters the
      other, and he now persuades himself to address the statue&mdash;now turns
      in terror to his master. The musical expression of fear by means of
      intervals of sevenths&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      but how characteristic is the difference between this cringing appeal for
      pity, and the former energetic cry extorted, as it might be, on the rack!
      The terror increases at each successive attempt to address the statue,
      while the energy of each address decreases, and dies away at last into a
      plaintive parlando. The orchestra at the same time adds the expression of
      insolent mockery, which is not less characteristic of the situation, in a
      playful but sharply accented <span class="side">DUET&mdash;LEPORELLO</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p175.png">[175]</a></span>
      passage, wherein the flutes are made especially effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Leporello's fears are verified and the statue actually moves,
      he succumbs to his terror, and Don Giovanr^ steps forward. Fear is a
      stranger to him; he sees the statue nod its head, and demands a more
      distinct answer; he puts his question plainly and decidedly; the statue
      answers by "Si." Leporello behaves as though struck by a thunderbolt, and
      has no idea but flight; even Don Giovanni is affected, and feels the
      supernaturalness, but he retains his self-possession; and, in the
      expression of trembling haste with which it hurries on the conclusion, the
      orchestra mingles something of the humorous impression which is given by
      the unexpected <i>dénouement</i> of the situation. The harmonic
      construction is here masterly in the extreme. From the beginning ^ to this
      point only the principal key and the one next related to it have been
      used; but now the interrupted cadence upon C major transports us to
      another atmosphere, and the altered movement of the orchestra is
      expressive of energetic activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few chords, however, lead Don Giovanni's questions at once back to the
      dominant of the principal key, and the forcible "Si" of the Commendatore
      answers with the tonic, the clear calm of which is destroyed at once by
      Leporello's C: the real conclusion is only arrived at circuitously. Very
      different in effect on both occasions is the occurrence of the same C in
      the bass. The first time, when C major follows decidedly on B major, it
      makes a fresh, elevating impression; the second time, when C follows the
      sustained E as the third below, and forms the basis for the chord of the
      third, fourth and sixth, it gives a shock to the ear. The vivid reality
      with which the two contrasting individualities are made to express
      themselves in so unusual a situation has necessitated the free form of the
      duet. Detached musical phrases, complete in themselves, follow the play of
      the emotions without the elaboration or repetition of any of the subjects;
      only Leporello's cry of terror recurs several times, and serves to a
      certain extent as a connecting link. Mozart has judiciously refrained from
      bringing the horror of a spectral apparition objectively before his
      hearers. Their imagination has been sufficiently worked upon by the <span
      class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p176.png">[176]</a></span> awful and imposing words of the
      Commendatore,<a href="#linknote38-154" name="linknoteref38-154"
      id="linknoteref38-154"> 154 </a> and their attention ought not to be
      diverted from Don Giovanni and Leporello. The freedom which permits of a
      playful treatment of Leporello's double fear and of Don Giovanni's
      consternation reposes mainly on the half-light in which the ghostly
      element is viewed. The spectator is impelled to accept the mixture of the
      horrible as a flavouring to the humorous; he is not in the least absorbed
      by horror. As soon as the ghost appears bodily, he comes to the foreground
      and gives tone and colour to all the rest; it is of advantage to the
      effect that none of the resources of musical delineation are employed to
      heighten this point. The true economy of an artist not only concentrates
      his resources on one point, but finds its truest expression in his
      appearing to disdain their use at another. The main point here was the
      audible voice of the statue, and Mozart gave it no support but the
      vibration of the horn note; this necessitated the greatest simplicity in
      the whole musical rendering of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the Commendatore in the last finale is led up to in
      truly masterly fashion. First we have the display of the luxurious living
      which has erased from Don Giovanni's mind all remembrance of what has
      passed. Leporello's greediness, with the jests upon it which were
      customary in this part of the piece, are made subservient to the more
      delicate humour of the table music. The entrance of Elvira heightens the
      situation, and the contrast of her deeply moved feelings and Don
      Giovanni's frivolous excitement introduces a new turn, and prepares for
      the catastrophe. Leporello feels, indeed, that Elvira is in the right, but
      dares not oppose his master, and so introduces no dissonant tone into the
      strongly marked character of this scene. But when the catastrophe draws
      near it is Leporello who, as he opened the action at the beginning of the
      opera, now announces the dread apparition at its close. All the <span
      class="side">THE COMMENDATORE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p177.png">[177]</a></span> terror he has hitherto been a
      prey to is as nothing compared with his mortal anguish at the sight of the
      marble guest, and even to the commands of his master he answers only with
      cries of terror; we feel that, ludicrous as the gestures of the cowardly
      fellow may be, something must have happened that would have alarmed any
      one, however courageous. Then there enters the Commendatore, accompanied
      by! soul-harrowing sounds.<a href="#linknote38-155"
      name="linknoteref38-155" id="linknoteref38-155"> 155 </a> No human
      passion, no anger, no pity speaks from his awful tones: the inflexible
      decree of an eternal law is embodied in all its sublimity in music. The
      warning words pursue their measured course, now tarrying upon one note
      with varied chords, now moving in forcible intervals, the heavy weight
      accumulating till it threatens to annihilate the culprit. The orchestra is
      calmer and quieter even than before, but adds many finely shaded touches
      to the image of the apparition. At one time it strengthens the weighty
      tread of the sustained sounds by the sharp rhythm of dotted notes&mdash;then
      again it falls in dissonant chords upon strongly accented notes, or gives
      expression to the curdling horror which seizes the hearer, by means of
      rapid ascending and descending scales. In face of this dread apparition
      Don Giovanni summons all his strength together. At first, indeed he is
      consternated, and the orchestra gives expression to his horror; but he
      soon collects himself, becomes more and more decided as the Commendatore
      continues to urge him, the call to repentance serving merely as a
      challenge to his defiance: his fall is inevitable. Again, as at the first,
      the two stand opposite each other in deadly struggle, but now it is Don
      Giovanni who is forced to yield, powerless against the forces of the
      unseen world. Mozart has endued the awe-struck sublimity <span class="side">DON
      GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p178.png">[178]</a></span>
      of this scene with noble beauty and force of climax, and has even ventured
      to invest it with something of a comic tone. Leporello's abject fear
      during such a conflict was a matter of course, but it would be foreign to
      his nature even under these circumstances, to be altogether silent. When,
      with chattering teeth and shaking limbs, he sings his triplets when, upon
      the Commendatore's question "Verrai?" he calls in deadly fear to his
      master&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      every one must feel how wofully in earnest the poor wretch is, and how he
      is ludicrous not of his own free will, but because he cannot help it.
      Every-day life shows how easily the sublime or the awful passes into the
      ridiculous, and how the incongruous emotion thus produced only strengthens
      the impression of horror; the blending of these contrasting elements into
      a true and living representation in art can only be accomplished by a
      great genius. There is scarcely anything in dramatic music which can
      compare in this respect with this scene of "Don Giovanni."
    </p>
    <p>
      Leporello is not conscious of the ridicule he incurs by his cowardice, and
      in truth it forms but one feature in his character. His air (Act II., 7)
      following the sestet, in which he seeks to justify himself on all sides,
      looking out at the same time for an opportunity of escape, makes his
      cunning more apparent than his fear. He has collected his senses, and,
      convinced that once recognised he has nothing more to fear, he only seeks
      to fortify himself with excuses until he can escape. The air is therefore
      lighter and easier in tone, in strong contrasts, varying according to the
      quarters to which he addresses himself, but in no way elaborated, and
      coming to an end with a musical point charmingly expressive of the words.
      The moderated tone of the piece is of very good effect after the ponderous
      length of the sestet. Leporello is a dissipated, insolent fellow, but,
      little as his principles can stand before a threat or a bribe, he has not
      so completely emancipated himself from all moral restraint <span
      class="side">LEPORELLO&mdash;AIRS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p179.png">[179]</a></span> as has his master. He has little
      scruple, however, in accepting his part in the villainies planned by Don
      Giovanni, who makes use of him chiefly to get rid of Elvira. In the
      celebrated air (Act I., 4) in which, professedly by way of consolation, he
      unrolls the list of his master's amours, he does not conceal the pleasure
      which the remembrance of the love adventures and the thought of the trick
      he is playing on Elvira afford him. In the first part the enumeration of
      the long list is made parlando, only here and there the accent is somewhat
      raised for effect, as at the famous "Ma in Ispagna son già mille e trè";
      but the orchestra, in lively motion all the time, betrays the reminiscence
      of jovial and licentious adventures which is passing through the mind of
      the speaker. He grows warmer over his description of his master's tastes
      and habits, and gives full expression to every detail, until his final
      malicious apostrophe, "Voi sapete quel che fa," is given with undisguised
      mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who have heard how Lablache sang&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      Quel che fa under his breath, and a little through his nose, with an
      indescribable side glance at Elvira, can have an idea of the comic
      ill-nature which Mozart meant to throw into this conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characterisation, appropriate in every detail and inimitable in its
      rendering of Leporello's secret complacency,<a href="#linknote38-156"
      name="linknoteref38-156" id="linknoteref38-156"> 156 </a> can only be
      rightly appreciated with the Italian words; the German translation is most
      faulty where the musical treatment demanded the strictest accuracy; the
      mode of expression, too, is purely Italian, sometimes only comprehensible
      in conjunction with Italian pantomime. When indeed he extols "nella bionda
      la gentilezza, nella <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p180.png">[180]</a></span> bruna la
      costanza, nella bianca la dolcezza," the expression is universally
      applicable, and the <i>grande maestoso</i> rises plainly before the minds
      of all; but when we come to&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      the proper effect cannot be rendered in German. In the streets of any town
      in Italy it may be observed how, when anything is to be described as
      small, the person describing it repeats the word eight or ten times with
      great rapidity, lowering the hand by degrees nearer and nearer to the
      ground; and the action could not possibly be better indicated than in this
      place by Mozart. There is a similar effect in the terzet (Act II., 2)
      where Leporello cannot contain his laughter&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      Se se-gui-ta-te ri-do, ri-do, ri-do, ri-do, ri-do, ri-do, ri-do, ri-do,
      ri-do, ri-do, and the silent internal chuckle of the Italian is musically
      expressed to perfection. More especially has the rapid utterance, one of
      the principal devices of opera buffa, a totally different signification in
      Italian and German. It is not natural to the German, and appears either
      exaggerated or vulgar; it should therefore be seldom and carefully
      employed as a means of characterisation. For an Italian, on the contrary,
      rapid speech, for which his language is so well adapted, is the natural
      expression of excitement, and the only question for him is whether he
      shall give vent to his feelings or exercise control over them. In Italian
      opera it is used without scruple, and without in itself aiming at making a
      comic impression; the circumstances, persons engaged, and manner employed
      give the character of the piece. In the part of Leporello the rapid
      parlando has a very different expression in different situations, and can
      always be justified on psychological grounds. But it is by no means
      exclusively the characteristic of comic persons. In the first finale (Act
      I., 13) Masetto's rapid outpouring of jealous rage, Zerlina's fear and
      distress, are not intended to move the <span class="side">THE RAPID
      PARLANDO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p181.png">[181]</a></span>
      audience to laughter; they merely give natural expression to their
      feelings, and it is the situation which produces the comic effect. These
      characters, it is true, belong to the lower classes, to whom some
      indulgence might be accorded in respect of good manners; but even Don
      Giovanni makes free use of his tongue when he ceases to exercise control
      over himself. In his intercourse with Leporello especially he allows much
      freedom to his servant, and lowers himself to the same level; this is of
      course made apparent in the musical expression, and various small
      indications of a free and easy tone of conversation have an extraordinary
      effect on the free and vivid conception of the whole. In the short duet
      (Act II., 1) in which he appeases the incensed Leporello, he expresses
      himself altogether after the manner of the latter, but it must be
      remembered that Leporello is really highly indignant, while Don Giovanni
      is only in joke all the time; in this contrast consists the comic point of
      the situation. Again, too, in the first finale, when he loses presence of
      mind for a moment, he falls into this rapid utterance with the words: "È
      confusa la mia testa," which, as soon as he has collected himself, ceases
      again with the words "ma non manca-in me coraggio." In the quartet (Act
      I.) the danger threatening him through Elvira excites him so greatly that
      in counselling her to be careful&mdash;"Siate un poco più prudente"&mdash;the
      rapidity of his address betrays his own loss of self-control. There is
      something of a comic tone in this, but the gravity of the situation does
      not allow it to go beyond a mere shade, and even this rapid parlando ought
      not to assume a really buffo character. Elvira herself, with the unbridled
      passion of her nature, gives vent to her anger in winged words, which are
      certainly not calculated to produce a comic effect. Donna Anna, on the
      other hand, and Don Ottavio, persons of high birth and breeding, never so
      far lose command over themselves as to fall into this hurried speech. The
      quartet just mentioned is one of the finest instances of the quality and
      extent of Mozart's genius. The conversation between Donna Anna, Don
      Ottavio, and Don Giovanni is most unexpectedly interrupted by the warnings
      of Elvira; the two first are amazed, and uncertain what to make of it,
      <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p182.png">[182]</a></span> while Don Giovanni, alarmed,
      seeks by deception to keep them in uncertainty, and to silence Elvira. All
      this gives rise to a genuinely musical variety of mood tinged with
      melancholy by the grief of Donna Anna and Don Ottavio. A most prominent
      feature of the whole is the skilful grouping. Donna Anna and Don Ottavio
      are inseparable, and form the nucleus of the piece; Elvira and Don
      Giovanni, though in opposition, are sometimes together, and sometimes in
      conjunction with the other two. The situation demands that Elvira shall be
      most frequently isolated, in contrast with the three remaining characters;
      and as her passionate excitement keeps her in the foreground, she gives
      the tone to the whole piece, and Don Giovanni is constrained to follow
      her, while Don Ottavio and Donna Anna only occasionally emerge from their
      mood of anxious contemplation. A touch of dramatic truth is the adoption
      by the orchestra and other voices of Elvira's motif to the words&mdash;[See

    </p>
    <p>
      so that it seems to be the key to the riddle forcing itself on the ear and
      betraying Don Giovanni's guilt. The motif recurs after all the reproaches,
      questions, and appeals, and dies away in gentle but pained reproach when
      the true position of affairs is left unexplained. The suspicion which here
      enters the mind of Donna Anna prepares the way for the conviction which
      forces itself upon her that Don Giovanni is the murderer of her father.
      The grouping of the voices is treated primarily as a means of
      psychological characterisation. The entrance of Elvira in the second
      finale gives Leporello a moral shock which brings him musically <i>en
      rapport</i> with Elvira, and their parts are therefore in correspondence;
      indeed, towards the end they are in close imitation<a

      terzet again (Act II., 2), Leporello is first associated with Don Giovanni
      and afterwards with Elvira, whom he begins by reviling, but who later
      arouses his sympathy, while Don Giovanni holds aloof from them both. This
      power of grouping the parts so that they shall serve the purposes of
      psychological and dramatic characterisation as well as of musical
      construction, is observable in every one of the ensemble pieces.

      L. Bassi (1766-1825), who is described as an excellent and well-trained
      singer, and as a man of fine exterior and pleasing manners,<a
      href="#linknote38-158" name="linknoteref38-158" id="linknoteref38-158">
      158 </a> was, we are told, very much annoyed that, as the chief personage
      of the opera, he had no grand air to sing; this was probably felt by
      others as a blemish in the work. If the nature of Don Giovanni had at all
      resembled that of Faust, he could not have failed to give some expression
      to the mental conflict between sensuality and misanthropy on the one hand,
      and the impulses of his higher moral nature on the other; and such a
      conflict would have lent itself readily to musical representation. But Don
      Giovanni has no scruples of the kind; the gratification of his desires is
      his sole object, and to this he devotes himself in all the consciousness
      of his own strength. Danger entices him as calling forth his powers; he
      delights in jests which demonstrate his superiority to his victim, and
      sensual enjoyment is his only real object in life. He pursues it neither
      with the lust of a fiend nor with the passion of a strongly moved nature,
      but with a reckless abandonment to sensual impulses taking absolute
      possession of all his faculties, and so coming into momentary contact with
      the nobler capabilities which exist in every soul. Imposing strength,
      external refinement, a jovial and even humorous manner are, indeed, far
      from ennobling or dignifying such a character; but they render it less
      despicable, and reflect line for line the manners of the age which
      produced Tirso's "Don Juan" and Da Ponte's "Don Giovanni." Music, which in
      its very nature gives preference and expression to the emotional element
      of the human mind, <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p184.png">[184]</a></span> was the only
      fitting exponent of such a creation in the world of art.<a
      href="#linknote38-159" name="linknoteref38-159" id="linknoteref38-159">
      159 </a> A nature such as that of Don Giovanni does not express itself in
      monologue, but in action, and we learn to know him almost exclusively in
      his relations to others. It is only when he is directing Leporello to
      prepare a costly banquet, and abandoning himself to the anticipation of
      the enjoyment it will afford him, that he gives musical expression to his
      excitement in an air, or rather in a <i>Lied</i> (Act I., 11). His mind is
      engrossed with the idea of the ball, and he predicts the situation which
      actually occurs in the finale; even the three different dances are
      mentioned by name:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Senza alcun ordine
     La danza sia

     Chi la follia
     Chi 1' alemanna
     Farai ballar.
</pre>
    <p>
      Starting with this idea, Mozart has given him a simple and very lively
      dance song to sing, in which nothing of the higher passions and still less
      either of demoniacal lust or noble sentiment can be traced, but only a
      very powerful expression of sensual impulse in a sort of fleeting
      paroxysm. The very pleasing and impressive melody, the simple harmony, the
      marked rhythm, and especially the instrumentation, all combine to produce
      a happy effect. The flutes and violins, which lead the melody almost
      without interruption, maintain the dance-like character of the song, and
      the uniformly rapid movement of the accompaniment produces a singular
      degree of excitement, enhanced by the strong accents of the wind
      instruments. So again, the digression into the minor key, making the sting
      of <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI&mdash;AIRS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p185.png">[185]</a></span> unbridled passion to be felt in
      the very indulgence of it, is of very striking effect. The serenade (Act
      II., 3) is of a totally different character; Mozart has written <i>Canzonetta</i>
      against it. Don Giovanni here pours out the whole warmth of his feelings
      towards the fair one whose heart he hopes to win. The Italian version of
      the song has a national character both in rhythm and language; it is of
      little consequence whether Don Giovanni is supposed to be singing a
      well-known song, or improvising one. The irresistible, insinuating
      flattery of this song, the state of voluptuous longing which it expresses,
      have the same sort of effect upon us as the dazzling colour and
      intoxicating perfume of some rare exotic flower; there is nothing, even in
      Mozart, which can be compared to it. The effect of the charming melody,
      and of the well-chosen harmonies, is much enhanced by the <i>pizzicato</i>
      mandoline accompaniment supported by the stringed instruments. The tender,
      curiously vibrating tone of the metal strings of the mandoline seems
      inseparable from the sweet gracefulness of the song; the instrument was
      then in common use (Mozart has written several songs to the mandoline,
      Vol. II., p. 371, note), and its effect was thus all the more
      characteristic.<a href="#linknote38-160" name="linknoteref38-160"
      id="linknoteref38-160"> 160 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The only real air which Don Giovanni sings, he sings not as Don Giovanni;
      disguised as Leporello, he is giving Masetto and his companions directions
      for catching himself, and the musical characterisation must therefore
      approach burlesque. This air (Act II., 4), "Metà di voi qua vadano,"
      belongs undoubtedly to those original conceptions which one admires
      without exactly understanding how they have been brought about. The
      situation in itself affords no proper musical impulse; it treats merely of
      the posting of scouts, of communication by signals, the speaker himself
      being thrown into a dubious light by reason of his disguise, and none
      <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p186.png">[186]</a></span> but a great genius could have
      found in this place a nucleus round which to develop a musical
      masterpiece. The character of the piece is of course buffo, not only
      because Don Giovanni is playing the part of Leporello, but because he is
      himself thoroughly enjoying the trick he is playing Masetto; these motives
      must therefore be blended. It is only necessary to compare this song with
      those of Leporello (Act I., 4; II., 7), to appreciate the essential
      difference in their style. The rapidly spoken passages give a tone of
      vulgarity, which is relieved by occasional involuntary expressions of
      greater dignity; passages such as&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      could not have been sung by Leporello; they show us the cavalier beneath
      his disguise. In accordance with the situation the voice is kept parlando;
      and the orchestra to which the constructive detail is intrusted is so
      independently treated that it might without injury dispense with the
      voice, although each is in fact the necessary complement of the other. The
      mysterious importance and the apparent confidence of Don Giovanni, which
      form the fundamental motif of the situation when contrasted with the
      earnest attention and curiosity of the country people, are humorously
      conceived and the orchestra renders every turn of what is passing in the
      minds of all concerned. But, in spite of this, the musical
      characterisation can only be made fully effective by suitable pantomime on
      the part of all the characters, even of those who do not speak, except
      through the orchestra. Don Giovanni's true character, however, is not
      displayed until he comes in contact with the other, and more especially
      with the female, characters of the opera. His seductive powers are first
      practised towards Zerlina. She is represented as a simple village <span
      class="side">ZERLINA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p187.png">[187]</a></span> maiden; and the little duet (Act
      I., 5) which she sings with her affianced lover amid the joyful
      acclamations of their friends, expresses innocent gladness in the simplest
      possible manner and with quite a popular tone.<a href="#linknote38-161"
      name="linknoteref38-161" id="linknoteref38-161"> 161 </a> Don Giovanni is
      the first to arouse sentiments which have hitherto slumbered unsuspected
      in her bosom. The simple peasant girl becomes an easy prey to the elegant
      man of the world; her vanity is flattered by his condescension, and his
      way of expressing the tender emotions excited in him by sensual
      gratification impresses Zerlina's innocent mind with a conviction of
      truthfulness, and rouses so irresistible a love towards him that all other
      considerations are cast into the shade. This is the main idea expressed in
      the duet (Act I., 6), wherein Don Giovanni makes speedy conquest of
      Zerlina's heart. The feeling of mutual satisfaction to which they both
      yield, as it has been preceded by no strife of passions, gives rise to an
      expression of unalloyed happiness cradled in softest, warmest sunlight.
      The second part was indeed required to contain more of fire and passion,
      but the truth of the characterisation has probably suffered thereby.
      Zerlina's nature is neither deep nor passionate, but light and
      impressionable; and Don Giovanni's chief weapon is his power of
      assimilating himself to the woman whom he designs to attract. This point
      has been made admirable use of by Mozart.<a href="#linknote38-162"
      name="linknoteref38-162" id="linknoteref38-162"> 162 </a> Such a broad
      psychological fact is, however, easy to represent; that which can neither
      be analysed nor reproduced is the effect of the tender intensity of the
      simple notes, which penetrate the soul like the glance of a loving eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the second interview between the two the state of affairs is
      considerably modified. Zerlina has been warned by Elvira; she has just
      calmed Masetto's jealousy with some difficulty, and is aware that he
      overhears; she seeks, therefore, to repel <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p188.png">[188]</a></span> Don
      Giovanni, though conscious that he has lost none of his old attraction for
      her. He knows this, and answers her petition for mercy with her own motif,
      whereby the love-making is as delicately characterised as immediately
      afterwards his astonishment at finding Masetto in ambush, and the quick
      presence of mind with which he ceremoniously greets him, whereupon Don
      Giovanni's own phrase is mockingly repeated by Masetto. The orchestra,
      after accompanying the lovers with strains as tender as their own, here
      gives inimitable expression to suppressed scorn and resentment. The dance
      music is heard, however, and relieves the strain; all except Zerlina feel
      the relief, and hasten within. As the festivities proceed, and Zerlina,
      watched by Masetto's jealous eyes, endeavours to elude Don Giovanni's
      pursuit of her until he leads her to the dance and then carries her off,<a
      href="#linknote38-163" name="linknoteref38-163" id="linknoteref38-163">
      163 </a> the complicated situation is characterised, as a whole, with firm
      and distinct touches, and the individual points are allowed to fall into
      the background. When she has been delivered from Don Giovanni's hands her
      feelings for him have undergone a revulsion, and henceforward she is found
      among the number of his pursuers. Her passing inclination for the
      libertine has, however, roused into life a germ which is fostered and
      developed by her relations towards Masetto. At first her intercourse with
      her lover is unreserved and entirely happy. Masetto is represented as a
      course, jealous, but good-natured clown, and appears at a disadvantage
      when compared with Zerlina, Don Giovanni, or even with Leporello. Mozart
      has sketched his figure for us in simple graphic lines, never bringing him
      to the foreground, but always giving him his right place in the ensemble
      movements, to which he contributes his share of life and colour. He only
      asserts himself once in an air, when Don Giovanni is sending him away in
      order to be alone with Zerlina. This is of a decidedly buffo character,
      and, compared with the <span class="side">MASETTO&mdash;ZERLINA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p189.png">[189]</a></span> airs of
      Don Giovanni and Leporello, affords a totally distinct but equally
      faithful picture of character; His indignation, only restrained from
      respect for the great man, which would fain vent itself in ironical
      bitterness, his coarse sarcasm, which he intends to be so delicate and
      biting, are admirably characterised. The very first motif of the
      orchestra, where the ominous horns are again distinctly heard&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      at which he exclaims, "Ho capito, signor si," shows by the monotonous
      repetition of increasingly emphatic bars how engrossed he is in the one
      idea which has taken possession of his mind. The two motifs with which he
      sarcastically addresses Zerlina and Don Giovanni are also admirably
      characteristic; and equally so the conclusion, where he does not know how
      to stop; and the syncopated rhythm adds not a little force to the
      expression of his perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zerlina's two airs are in vivid contrast to the coarse and boorish, but
      honest character of her lover. They express neither affection nor
      tenderness, but rather the consciousness of her own superiority, which her
      intercourse with Don Giovanni has revealed to her. Hers is one of those
      easy natures which are volatile without being actually untrue, whose
      feelings are the children of the passing moment, and whose charm is
      enhanced by the excitement of the moment. The master has inspired this
      lovely and graceful form with a breath of warm sentiment, without which
      she would be cold; and her roguish smile saves her from the reproach of
      mere sentimentality. The first air (Act I., 12) takes its tone from
      Zerlina's desire to pacify Masetto; but there is no trace of a need for
      forgiveness&mdash;of the consciousness of an unlawful love; she disarms
      her lover's wrath with caressing tenderness, and gives him glimpses of
      bliss which he is far too weak to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible to conceive a more charming love-making, and no
      false note of sentimentality mars the graceful picture. The obbligato
      violoncello lends itself in a singular degree to the individual
      characterisation, its restless <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p190.png">[190]</a></span>
      movement and soft low sound standing in happiest contrast to the clear
      fresh voices; the accompaniment completes what the singer leaves unsaid.
      It portrays the anxious hesitation in the minds of both the lovers; and
      not until the second part does the motion flow free and full, till all
      resentment dies away in gentle murmurings. The second air (Act II., 5),
      corresponds to a different situation. Masetto has been beaten, and Zerlina
      tries to console him; if she were to put on an air of sentimental gravity
      it would appear absurd; the roguish playfulness with which Mozart has
      endowed the broader merriment indicated by the words is far more
      appropriate here, and gives the expression of pure and tender grace, which
      renders this one of the most attractive of songs. The clearness and
      brightness of the instrumentation compared with that of the first air is
      very striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different is Don Giovanni's behaviour towards Elvira.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ungrateful part of a deserted mistress has for the most part been
      neglected. If a great artist, such as Schroder-Devrient, had conceived the
      idea of embodying on the stage the dignified character of Elvira as Mozart
      created it, the representation of the opera would have been placed on an
      altogether different footing. Elvira is in an outward position of equality
      with Don Giovanni. She is his superior in nobility of mind, and she has
      been deeply injured by him. Her first air (Act I., 3)<a
      href="#linknote38-164" name="linknoteref38-164" id="linknoteref38-164">
      164 </a> shows her as a woman of strong character and passionate feeling,
      as far from the ladylike reserve of Donna Anna as from the youthful grace
      of Zerlina. As unreservedly as she had given her love to Don Giovanni does
      she now yield to her thirst for revenge, and even this proceeds not so
      much from injured pride as from disappointed love, ready to burst in new
      flames from its ashes. The tone-colouring of the instrumentation in this
      air is in very striking contrast to that of the previous songs; clarinets
      are used for the first time, and with the horns and bassoons (no flutes)
      give a full and brilliant effect. Don Giovanni overhearing her, and
      sympathising with her while <span class="side">ELVIRA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p191.png">[191]</a></span> not
      recognising her, together with the running comments he makes on her to
      Leporello, add a mixture of humour to the scene which could not be more
      gracefully expressed. The laugh is unsparingly turned against Elvira, and
      is occasioned by the passionateness with which she has compassed her own
      discomfiture. The musical rendering clearly shows that in her proper
      person she remains unaffected by it. Resolved to pursue Don Giovanni, and
      defeat his machinations, she intercepts him as he is hastening into his
      casino with Zerlina, and exclaims to the deluded maid:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ah! fuggi il traditor!
     Non lo lasciar più dir;
     Il labbro è mentitor
     E falso il ciglio!
     Da' miei tormenti impara
     A creder a quel cor
     A nasca il tuo timor
     Dal mio periglio!
</pre>
    <p>
      This air, unlike the rest of the opera, retains the form of the older
      school, then still frequently heard in church music.<a
      href="#linknote38-165" name="linknoteref38-165" id="linknoteref38-165">
      165 </a> Apparently Mozart made use of the severe, harsh form which at
      once suggests the idea of sacred music to the hearer, in order to give the
      impression of a moral lecture, and to emphasise the contrast with the "gay
      intoxication of self-forgetfulness" of the rest of the scene.<a
      href="#linknote38-166" name="linknoteref38-166" id="linknoteref38-166">
      166 </a> This mode of address was appropriately and suggestively employed
      towards the peasant maid; but Elvira adopts quite another tone when she
      returns and finds Don Giovanni in close converse with Donna Anna. In the
      quartet (Act I., 8) (likely 9, DW) her warning, in accordance with the
      exalted rank of the mourners, takes a plaintive tone, and her passion only
      flares up again when roused by Don Giovanni's duplicity. Then she comes
      forward, and her energetic tone predominates in the ensemble movements,
      although the silent power of true nobility and grief exerts a moderating
      influence on her expressions of passion. She makes a similar impression
      <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p192.png">[192]</a></span> in the first finale (Act I.,
      13). She has explained herself to Donna Anna and Don Ottavio, and they are
      leagued together to watch and to expose Don Giovanni. When they appear
      masked in front of the casino she encourages them to act boldly; Don
      Ottavio chimes in with her, but Donna Anna is seized with maidenly fears
      face to face with such an adventure. All this is expressed in the most
      admirable manner, and a few touches suffice to place the two women before
      us in all the dissimilarity of their natures. The accompaniment, too, is
      unusually characteristic. In sharp contrast to the cheerful excitement in
      which Don Giovanni, Zerlina, and Masetto make their exit stands the
      mournful accompaniment to Elvira, while Don Ottavio's powerful tenor notes
      are infused with additional energy by the accented passage? for the wind
      instruments. The accompaniment, without altering its essential character,
      adopts at Donna Anna's entrance an anxious plaintive tone expressive of
      the purity and elevation of her mind. After a short colloquy with
      Leporello, who invites them to enter, the three, confident in the justice
      of their cause, prepare for their difficult enterprise. After the restless
      energy of the previous scene this clear and composed expression of a
      deeper emotion diffuses a sense of calm beneficence. The construction of
      the movement places Donna Anna and Don Ottavio in close juxtaposition;
      Elvira is placed in opposition to them and, in accordance with her
      character, she is more animated and energetic. Here again the desired
      effect is much strengthened by the support of the orchestra. It was
      unusual to make use of the wind instruments alone in accompaniments; and
      in addition to this the full soft sound of the extended chords contrasts
      strikingly with the deep tones of the clarinets, heard now for the first
      time. What a contrast it forms, too, to the tone-colouring of the
      preceding movement; one feels for the moment transported to another world.
      Scarcely have the last echoes died away when the sharp attack of the
      orchestra on the following movement brings us down to earth again. In the
      scene which follows it is Elvira who is ever on the watch&mdash;who with
      Don Ottavio intercepts and <span class="side">ELVIRA&mdash;TERZET.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p193.png">[193]</a></span> unmasks
      Don Giovanni; after that she falls into her place with the rest.
      Implacable as Elvira shows herself in her pursuit of revenge on Don
      Giovanni, her love for him has taken such deep root in her heart, his
      personality exercises such a magic power over her, that she is ready to
      forget all that is past, and to trust herself to him again. Poetry could
      only make this visible by means of a chain of connecting links; music is
      happier in its power of rendering the most hidden springs of human action;
      once let the right key be struck, and the state of mind to be represented
      is there. And seldom has a frame of mind incapable of verbal description
      been so truly and beautifully expressed as in this terzet (Act II., 2). A
      short ritomello places the hearer in a frame of mind which enables him to
      give credence to what he is about to learn. Elvira, alone in the twilight,
      comes to the window; old memories awaken old feelings, which, while she
      deplores them, she cannot escape. Don Giovanni, who is present, resolves
      to turn this softened mood to account; he wishes to drive Elvira away, and
      a fresh triumph over her affections is a satisfaction to his arrogant
      vanity. Leporello in his master's hat and cloak is made to advance, and
      Don Giovanni, concealed behind him, addresses Elvira tenderly in the very
      notes which have just issued from her mouth. Don Giovanni's appeal comes
      to her like an echo of her own thoughts. She interrupts him with the same
      lively reproaches which she has already uttered to herself, while he prays
      for her pity with the most melting tenderness. Elvira is overcome, and
      thereupon very appropriately the motif occurs with which Leporello first
      expressed his consternation at Elvira's appearance. Don Giovanni persists
      all the more urgently in the same tone, and the turn of expression just
      alluded to is developed, with a startling impetus produced by the
      transition to the key of C major, into a cantilene of entrancing beauty.<a
      href="#linknote38-167" name="linknoteref38-167" id="linknoteref38-167">
      167 </a> <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p194.png">[194]</a></span> He answers Elvira's violent
      reproaches ("con transporto e quasi piangendo," Mozart has noted them)
      with exclamations of increasing passion, and threatens to kill himself if
      she does not grant his prayer. The feeling that Elvira must yield to so
      passionate an outburst of the love towards which her heart impels her is
      mingled with a sense of Leporello's ludicrous situation, and we feel no
      incongruity in his fit of laughter. But when Elvira actually yields, even
      Leporello cannot withhold his sympathy from her, while Don Giovanni
      mockingly triumphs in his victory. In a certain sense the two have
      exchanged their parts as well as their clothes. This terzet may safely be
      cited as an example of how simplicity of design and regularity of
      construction may unite with perfect beauty and truth of expression into a
      piece of genuine dramatic characterisation; but who can express in words
      the tender fragrance of loving desire which breathes from the music like
      the perfumes from an evening landscape? If we are to infer Don Giovanni's
      character from the duet with Zerlina (Act I., 6), the serenade (Act II.,
      3), and this terzet, we have the picture of an engaging and amiable
      personality which strikes every tone of affection and desire with
      bewitching grace and delicacy, and with an accent of such true feeling
      that it is impossible for the female heart to withstand him. This is not
      the whole of Don Giovanni's character, however. When Elvira's weakness has
      betrayed her into an equivocal position, Don Giovanni's heartless
      insolence places her in a situation which only Leporello's comic character
      prevents from becoming an exceedingly painful one. The fear which takes
      undisputed possession of him during the interview reflects a comic light
      upon Elvira, but without interfering with her preconceived character.
      Mozart has succeeded admirably in the sestet (Act II., 6) in maintaining
      Elvira's dignity of deportment both towards the craven Leporello and her
      former allies; she never sinks below herself; but the consciousness of her
      weakness and of the dastardly trick played upon her has broken her spirit.
      There is no trace of the energetic, flaming passion of the earlier Elvira;
      Donna Anna's pure <span class="side">ELVIRA&mdash;INSERTED AIR&mdash;FINALE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p195.png">[195]</a></span> form
      rises high above her, and she no longer takes the lead in the expression
      of astonishment and indignation. After the sestet, when Leporello had
      escaped from the hands of Zerlina, there was inserted in Vienna an air for
      Elvira, in which the violence of her passion is moderated to a degree
      almost incredible. The softened mood in which the feeling of her
      inextinguishable love is expressed no longer as anger against the traitor,
      but as pity for the lost sinner, is, when rightly delivered,<a
      href="#linknote38-168" name="linknoteref38-168" id="linknoteref38-168">
      168 </a> most admirably represented; but the dignity and nobleness which
      have stilled the waves of sorrow and revenge are not really consistent
      with the fire and force of the true Elvira. Then, also, the accents of
      disappointed love, which Mozart knew how to evoke with such masterly
      insight, are scarcely present at all in this air. Nevertheless, considered
      musically it is of great beauty, and the voices are most effectively
      supported by obbligato solo instruments, which are never elsewhere used in
      exactly the same way by Mozart. This charming piece is not inappropriate
      in its own place, but it does not render either situation or character
      with the same breadth or accuracy which Mozart elsewhere displays in "Don
      Giovanni." Any idea of a closer connection with Don Giovanni being now out
      of the question, Elvira, feeling also that her own existence is rendered
      worthless, resolves to enter a convent. But her character and her undying
      affection forbid her to part for ever from Don Giovanni without calling
      him to repentance and amendment. Her entrance in the second finale
      interrupts the merriment of Don Giovanni and Leporello at table, and, like
      a landscape in changing lights, the whole tone of the music is altered at
      a stroke.<a href="#linknote38-169" name="linknoteref38-169"
      id="linknoteref38-169"> 169 </a> Her warning here is very different to
      that which she addressed to Zerlina. A stream of glowing words comes from
      the very depths of her love-tossed heart, and beats in vain against the
      overweening pride of her heartless betrayer. At first he seeks to treat
      her appeal as a jest, which may be humoured; and when her prayers, her
      tears, her dismay are thereby <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p196.png">[196]</a></span>
      redoubled, he mocks at her with all the frivolity of his pleasure-seeking
      nature. This is too much even for Leporello: he sympathetically approaches
      Elvira; and the effect is very fine, when the same notes which seemed to
      threaten annihilation by their weight at Elvira's entrance are heard from
      the mouth of Leporello. Don Giovanni's overbearing insolence increases and
      calls down upon him the fate to which, now that even Elvira has left him,
      he is doomed to hasten. This scene is again a very masterpiece of high
      dramatic art. A flow of passionate emotion, like a lava stream down the
      mountain side, succeeds to the loosely connected musical jests of the
      supper-table. The very change of tone-colouring is of the greatest
      significance. The first noisy and brilliant movement, with its trumpets
      and drums and lively passages for the stringed instruments, is succeeded
      by the arranged harmony music, against which the full orchestra, with the
      combined strength of wind and stringed instruments, stands in bold relief.
      Don Giovanni and Elvira are here for the first time opposed on equal
      terms. Her passionate emotion is purified and ennobled without any loss of
      strength or reality; and he displays an energy and keen enjoyment of life
      which would have something great in it if it were directed to higher aims,
      but which here excites only horror. It prepares us for the resistance
      which he is to make to the spectral apparition; but the insolent scorn
      with which he hardens himself against Elvira's prayers is more shocking to
      the feelings than his determined resistance to the horrors of the nether
      world, wherein we cannot but grant him our sympathy. Sharply accented as
      are the mocking tone of mind and the sensuality of Don Giovanni, we never
      find him vulgar or revolting. This is due to the combination of strength
      and boldness with beauty of form in the music allotted to him. What can be
      more impressive than the oft-repeated motif given to Don Giovanni:&mdash;[See
      Page Image] <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI'S CHARACTER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p197.png">[197]</a></span> with no
      support but a simple bass, in strong contrast to the rich accompaniment
      elsewhere employed? His good breeding is as characteristic of him as his
      love of enjoyment, and is shown at his first entrance in his behaviour
      towards Donna Anna and the Commendatore. There is no roughness in his
      struggle with her, and he would fain avoid violence, as also in the combat
      with her father; not until his honour as a cavalier has been touched to
      the quick does he draw his sword, and the result of the duel causes him
      genuine emotion. True, his nobler impulses are not of long duration; he is
      destitute of generosity or nobility of mind, and his highest quality is
      mere brute courage. In the churchyard scene, when his arrogance has
      brought matters to a crisis, and Leporello has made his terrified exit,
      the horror of his situation rouses all Don Giovanni's determination, and
      he passes the bounds of foolhardiness in his defiance of the spectre. This
      scene, however, in which the defiance of a mortal is forced to yield to
      the higher powers, is a necessary sequel to the preceding one with Elvira,
      in which the moral conflict has just been fought out. Its pathos redeems
      it from burlesque, and spreads an impression of horror which overmasters
      human reason. Mozart's success in the combination of these qualities into
      a whole of harmonious beauty has already been admired by us as the work of
      a genius. Gracious and winning manners and overflowing strength and animal
      spirits, combined with the refinement of good birth and breeding and the
      frankness of a jovial temperament, produce a picture of a man richly
      endowed by nature, but requiring to bend to moral restraint before he can
      be called great or noble. He attracts liking, he rouses sympathy, but he
      is doomed to final overthrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Anna,<a href="#linknote38-170" name="linknoteref38-170"
      id="linknoteref38-170"> 170 </a> as the representative of intellectual
      elevation and moral purity, is placed in strong contrast to this seductive
      being, who attracts and degrades all with whom he comes in contact. She
      triumphs over him from the first, <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p198.png">[198]</a></span> the
      magic of his presence being powerless to affect her pure spirit. But her
      maidenly pride resents his unworthy advances; the idea that an insult so
      great should remain unpunished rouses such passion within her, that she
      loses sight of all save her just revenge. The music gives a tone of
      nobility and elevation to her passionate excitement, stamping her at once
      as the superior nature to which Don Giovanni yields, not only that he may
      escape recognition, but because he cannot help himself. Her relation to
      him preserves this tone throughout, and there is no subsequent suggestion
      of any closer or more personal interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoffmann's infelicitous idea that Donna Anna had been dishonoured by Don
      Giovanni is contradicted by Da Ponte's libretto, which emphasises her
      affection for Don Ottavio as repeatedly and decidedly as does the
      high-pitched ideality of the music. It is a grievous error to suppose that
      her "high-tragedy manner" towards her betrothed arises from the
      consciousness of shame and from falsehood and hypocrisy, and not rather
      from an elevated sense of pride and pure morality and from filial grief
      for her murdered father. Hoffmann's conception of the two chief
      characters, and their; relations to each other, though often quoted,<a
      href="#linknote38-171" name="linknoteref38-171" id="linknoteref38-171">
      171 </a> is in many respects a misleading one. A Don Giovanni, a very
      demon, who seeks in sensual love to satisfy his cravings for the
      supernatural; who, weary and satiated with earthly pleasures, despising
      mankind, and in utter scorn against nature and his Creator seeks to
      compass the ruin of every woman he meets, is as foreign to the age, the
      character, and the music of Mozart as a Donna Anna who, loving the
      greatness which originally existed in Don Giovanni, yields to him without
      resistance, only to feel doubly conscious of her abasement and absorbed in
      the desire for revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon her return with Don Ottavio she finds her father a corpse, and, after
      making the most pitiful lamentations, she becomes insensible. Coming to
      herself her first <span class="side">DONNA ANNA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p199.png">[199]</a></span>
      half-unconscious exclamation is for her father; she imagines that the
      murderer is before her, and beseeches him to slay her also. When the dread
      certainty has brought her to full consciousness, she collects all her
      forces for revenge. She makes Ottavio swear vengeance on the murderer, and
      her excitement rises to an unnatural joy at the prospect of the fulfilment
      of their gloomy task. The musical rendering of this state of mind is
      perfect. The high-pitched mood of Donna Anna is characterised with so much
      precision and delicacy, and the continuous climax is so consistent and
      well connected, chiefly by virtue of the musical construction, that we
      feel ourselves taken captive and prepared to accept what we hear as the
      involuntary outbursts of passion.<a href="#linknote38-172"
      name="linknoteref38-172" id="linknoteref38-172"> 172 </a> Even Don
      Ottavio's consolatory words, sharply as they contrast in their
      cantilene-like delivery with Donna Anna's broken interjections, betray in
      their restless accompaniment and changing harmonies the inner disquiet
      from which he cannot free himself. As soon, however, as the thought of
      revenge has been grasped, the two go together, and the voices are in close
      connection, while the orchestra (a chief factor in the musical rendering
      of the whole scene) contrasts with them in sharpest accents, now urging,
      now restraining; the long suspense of the detached, disconnected phrases
      is relieved by the stream of passion which seems to raise the weight from
      the hearts from which it flows. Don Ottavio, owing partly to the libretto,
      has acquired an unfavourable reputation that can scarcely be entirely
      overcome, even if the exaggerations which have become customary in his
      part should be discarded.<a href="#linknote38-173" name="linknoteref38-173"
      id="linknoteref38-173"> 173 </a> In real life we feel the highest esteem
      for a character which preserves calmness and clearness in the midst of
      heaviest trials, <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p200.png">[200]</a></span> and stands
      loyally and tenderly by the side of the afflicted; but we seldom find a
      poetic or passionate side to such a nature. Such an one is Don Ottavio. He
      preserves his composure amid the whirlwind of passion around him; his love
      imposes upon him the task of consoling and supporting his beloved one
      under the loss of her father, and he performs it in a manner at once
      tender and manly. He rises to greater strength in the summons to
      vengeance, when he shows himself in no way inferior to Donna Anna; and
      when the two next come upon the scene, it is he who exhorts Donna Anna to
      stifle her grief and to dream only of revenge. The unexpected appearance
      of Elvira, and Don Giovanni's behaviour inspire him with some degree of
      suspicion; but he and Donna Anna preserve in the quartet (Act I., 8) a
      dignified reserve towards the strangers, which has a depressing effect
      when united with their mournful contemplation of their own sorrow. Here
      they are entirely at one with each other, and so the music renders them;
      their superiority of birth and demeanour has its effect on the other two
      characters, and gives the tone to the whole. Don Giovanni's entrance, his
      glance and tone, inspire Donna Anna with the certainty of his being her
      father's murderer; the memory of that fearful event flashes across her,
      and the tumult of feeling which it arouses is expressed by the orchestra
      in pungent dissonances by means of opposing rhythm and harsh sounds
      produced especially by the trumpets, which have been silent since the
      overture until now. It is with difficulty that she composes herself
      sufficiently to acquaint her lover with the cause of her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she has told him all, she urges him again to revenge her father's
      death, in an air (Act I., 10) of which the delicate characterisation
      completes the perfect image of Donna Anna. This air, in comparison with
      the preceding recitative and with the duet, is temperate in tone. The
      renewed appeal for revenge is not the same involuntary outburst of passion
      which it was; it is the expression of conviction, and is therefore more
      composed, though not less forcible than before. A high and noble pride
      speaks in the first motifs (Vol. 11., p. 428)&mdash;[See Page Image] <span
      class="side">DONNA ANNA&mdash;OTTAVIO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p201.png">[201]</a></span> with inimitable dignity and
      force, while the plaintive sextoles of the violins and violas, the urgent
      figure for the basses, which turns to imitation at the second motif, and
      the gentle admonitory dialogue of the wind instruments represent the
      restless anxiety which has called forth her determination.<a
      href="#linknote38-174" name="linknoteref38-174" id="linknoteref38-174">
      174 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Donna Anna's elevation of mind raises the man of her choice, and her
      maidenly bashfulness gives her confidence a lover-like character. Ottavio,
      who has not been inspired with the same instinctive certainty of Don
      Giovanni's guilt, finds it hard to convince himself that a nobleman, and
      his friend, can be capable of such a crime; but he is quite ready to
      acknowledge the necessity for closely observing him. It was at this point
      that the air composed in Vienna was inserted (Anh. 3) to express Ottavio's
      devoted love for Donna Anna. It depicts exclusively the tender lover, and
      the heroic impulses which might be supposed to belong to the situation
      will be sought for in vain; the contrast with Donna Anna's high-spirited
      air is very striking. No doubt the insertion of the song was, in some
      measure at least, a concession to the individual singer and to the
      preference of the public for sentimental lovers. Granting this, however,
      it is simple and true in sentiment, tender without sickliness, and of
      purest melody. Besides the clear and lovely chief melodies, parts here and
      there, such as the transition to B minor and the return to D major at the
      words, "E non ho bene s' ella non l' ha," have a very striking effect. But
      the song <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p202.png">[202]</a></span> is below the level of the
      situation, and, for want of a counterbalancing force, it injures the
      conception of Don Ottavio's character. The masque terzet expresses in a
      very pure and noble manner the contrast between an affection based on
      moral constancy, such as that of Donna Anna and Don Ottavio, and the
      unwholesome passions of the other characters. Donna Anna, entering masked
      to play the spy on Don Giovanni, is seized with alarm at the danger which
      threatens them all, especially her lover&mdash;"Temo pel caro sposo" she
      sings with her own melting, plaintive tones&mdash;and she calms her fears
      with difficulty. In the ball-room, where noisy merriment is at its height,
      their dignified appearance gives the assembly a certain air of solemnity.
      Leporello and Don Giovanni greet them respectfully; they answer somewhat
      ceremoniously, and join in the cry: "Viva la libertà!" but with a sort of
      dignified reserve which stamps them as of superior rank to the crowd of
      country people round them. This is a faithful reflection of the manners of
      the time; so also is the subordination of the chorus in this scene: it was
      customary for country people to keep at a respectful distance before
      persons of rank. When the dance recommences, it is Donna Anna again who
      finds her feelings so hard to master that she almost betrays herself.
      Zerlina's cry for help is the signal for an outbreak of general
      excitement; and henceforth they are all avowedly ranged against Don
      Giovanni. Don Ottavio acts as the mouthpiece and champion of the women,
      and calls Don Giovanni to account for the murder of the Commendatore. But
      he makes no attempt to take the punishment of the crime into his own
      hands, and Don Giovanni is allowed to beat a retreat from the presence of
      his former friends and now determined opponents. No chorus is introduced
      in the last movement of the first finale, and indeed none is conceivable.<a
      href="#linknote38-175" name="linknoteref38-175" id="linknoteref38-175">
      175 </a> What would be gained in material sound-effects would be lost in
      true dramatic effect. The "buona gente" do not presume to take part in the
      <span class="side">DONNA ANNA&mdash;OTTAVIO</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p203.png">[203]</a></span> dispute of their lords; and, as
      the affair grows serious, the dancers and musicians leave the ball-room
      hastily, and the principal characters remain in possession of the scene.<a
      href="#linknote38-176" name="linknoteref38-176" id="linknoteref38-176">
      176 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Don Ottavio has shown himself as a man deserving of Donna Anna's
      affection and confidence, loyal and devoted, cautious and determined, and
      preserving throughout the lofty demeanour which distinguishes him from Don
      Giovanni. But from this point we are in expectation that he will put his
      resolutions into action, and that the second act gives him no opportunity
      of doing so is a serious blemish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loose and disconnected plot of the second act sacrifices Donna Anna
      and Don Ottavio in especial; Elvira, Zerlina, and Masetto are woven not
      unskilfully into its intricate meshes, but the other two are altogether
      left out. In the sestet (Act II., 6) the earlier motif of consolatory
      assurance is repeated without any definite occasion, and only the exalted
      purity of the music can cover this defect. Their presence is in no way
      necessary either to the exposure of Leporello's trickery; it is amply
      justified from a musical point of view, however, for the noble and
      dignified tone, which contrasts with Leporello's comic fright and gives
      the character of the ensemble, is the result of their participation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Giovanni's new villainy having removed all doubt of his guilt from Don
      Ottavio's mind, the latter no longer hesitates to call him to account. His
      conduct has rendered him unworthy of giving the ordinary satisfaction of a
      nobleman, and Ottavio resolves to deliver him over to justice, taking upon
      himself the risk of encountering so bold and formidable an adversary. As
      he turns to depart his thoughts naturally turn to Donna Anna, who has left
      the scene after the sestet, and he entreats his friends to console her
      during his absence, until he shall return with the tidings of a completed
      revenge. This feeling is natural and true, and the air (Act II., 8)
      expressing it is in every way appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His appeal for the consolation of Donna Anna is made in one of the
      loveliest cantilene which has ever been written for a tenor voice; but the
      second part is not quite on the <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p204.png">[204]</a></span> same
      level. Mozart has rightly refrained from expressing the desire for revenge
      in a grand heroic movement, which would have introduced a false tone, but
      has limited it to a middle movement, rendered characteristic mainly by the
      rapid and forcible motion of the orchestra. The purely musical effect of
      this part is excellent, but the voice part has not force or brilliancy
      proportionate to the sweetness and fulness which it has just displayed.
      The idiosyncracies of the singer Baglione may, in some degree, have
      occasioned this treatment; he was specially celebrated for his artistic
      and finished delivery.<a href="#linknote38-177" name="linknoteref38-177"
      id="linknoteref38-177"> 177 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of the plot justifies Don Ottavio in his conduct towards Don
      Giovanni, and when the reprobate has been called before a higher than any
      earthly tribunal, Ottavio claims Donna Anna's hand, not as a tender lover,
      but as a faithful protector summoned by fate to her side. Donna Anna's
      postponement of their union until the year of mourning for her father
      shall have expired is a realistic trait, and reflects the ordinary rules
      of society and mode of thought then in vogue too faithfully to be at all
      poetic. But there can be no doubt of the intention to represent the love
      of Donna Anna and Don Ottavio as deep and sincere; and it argues a
      misapprehension of tragic ideality to consider the postponement either as
      an excuse to conceal her aversion to her lover, or as the result of her
      determination to renounce earthly love and seek refuge in a convent or the
      grave.<a href="#linknote38-178" name="linknoteref38-178"
      id="linknoteref38-178"> 178 </a> It is to the disadvantage of Don Ottavio,
      however, that he is made to re-enter and entreat Donna Anna to consent to
      an immediate union, without any previous intimation that he has carried
      out his design of bringing Don Giovanni to justice. This is uncalled for,
      and shows him in the light of an amorous weakling destitute of energy.<a

      href="pgimages/p205.png">[205]</a></span> churchyard scene from the
      supper, and chiefly, no doubt, to supply Donna Anna with another air; the
      characterisation of Don Ottavio and the natural progress of the plot are
      sacrificed to these objects. On the other hand, the air itself (Act II.,
      10) is a grateful task for the singer; and affords important aid to the
      musical-dramatic characterisation of Donna Anna. Hitherto grief and
      revenge have inspired her utterances; her affection to Don Ottavio has
      been indicated by her intrusting to him her most sacred interests and
      duties. Here, at last, her love breaks forth without reserve, and although
      she still rejects his petition, it is with a maidenly coyness and an
      expression of regret which add a new and individual interest to her
      character. The air is introduced by a recitative, and consists of two
      independent movements in different tempi. In form and treatment,
      especially in the employment of wind instruments almost solo, and in the
      bravura voice passages, it more closely resembles the traditional Italian
      aria than any other of the original songs in Don Giovanni; but, in spite
      of this, it renders important service to the characterisation.<a
      href="#linknote38-180" name="linknoteref38-180" id="linknoteref38-180">
      180 </a> The regularity of the musical form corresponds very well to the
      refined and not only noble but well-bred demeanour of Donna Anna. Deep and
      sincere emotion is expressed with maidenly tenderness, infused with just
      the tinge of melancholy which invests the whole representation of her
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters which have been occupying our attention are so accurately
      and minutely delineated, and every detail is so admirably blended into the
      conception of the whole, that though a comparison with "Figaro" may
      doubtless show many superficial points of resemblance, a closer
      examination reveals the complete independence of the two works. No one
      figure resembles another even distantly; each has its own life, its own
      individuality, preserved in the minutest particulars, as well as in the
      general conception. Not less remarkable than this is the art with which
      the different <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p206.png">[206]</a></span> elements, in all their force of
      energy and truth, are combined into an harmonious and comprehensive whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      As regards the dramatic force and reality of the situations, especially in
      the ensembles, "Figaro" has the advantage over "Don Giovanni." The
      introduction to the first act is admirably planned, both musically and
      dramatically; in the quartet (Act I., 8) and terzet (Act II., 2) the
      situation and prevailing tone are simple, but well chosen and sustained;
      and the idea of giving Don Giovanni and Leporello a share in Elvira's
      first air (Act I., 3), is productive of excellent effect. The sestet (Act
      II., 6), on the other hand, is very loosely put together; the characters
      are grouped round Leporello suitably enough, it is true, but their
      encounter is not the natural result of the situation, and the climax is a
      purely external one. The finales in "Don Giovanni" are indeed far superior
      to the ordinary run, which even in good operas often consist of loosely
      strung scenes which might just as well be spoken as sung, but they are
      inferior to the well-combined, consistent* development of the plot which
      delights us in the finales in "Figaro." The first finale begins in lively
      style with the quarrel between Masetto, whose jealously is newly awakened,
      and the terrified Zerlina, who seeks to avoid an outbreak. The insidious
      ever-recurring motif for both voice and orchestra&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      in contrast with the quickly uttered notes and sharp accents of anger, is
      highly expressive of suspicion. Suggestive in another way are the beating
      notes for the trumpets&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      which are interposed in Masetto's speech, and afterwards taken up by the
      flutes&mdash; <span class="side">FIRST FINALE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p207.png">[207]</a></span> when Zerlina asserts herself,
      rising gradually to impatient quavers for the violin&mdash;[See Page
      Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      while the principal subject pursues its quiet course. They are interrupted
      by the noisy merriment of Don Giovanni and his companions, who are
      repairing to the merry-making in the casino; the gradual dying away of the
      song of the retreating guests prepares us for the singularly tender and
      lovely scene between Zerlina and Don Giovanni, which, contrasted with the
      preceding duet with Masetto, first clearly shows the dangerous fascination
      of the seducer. After the inimitably expressed start of surprise at
      Masetto's reappearance the music alters altogether in character, and Don
      Giovanni assumes a cordial hospitality and cheerful gaiety which is partly
      accounted for by the sound of the dance music from the casino; this is
      made also a musical prophecy of what is to ensue, for the eight bars that
      are heard are taken from the second of the dances afterwards combined, and
      Mozart has omitted the two first bars, in order to put the hearer at once
      in the midst of the dance (Vol. II., p. 154 note). A lively figure for the
      violin expresses the desire of the three to join in the merriment. The
      figure is continued when Elvira, Donna Anna, and Don Ottavio appear, and
      several accompaniment figures are also retained, with important
      modifications. The minor key for the first time occurring, and the totally
      different treatment of the orchestra give an impression of a mysterious
      and gloomy shadow cast upon the noisy merriment of the scene. Leporello,
      opening a window by chance, sees the masks, and is ordered by his master
      to invite them to enter. The open window causes the dance music to be more
      plainly heard, and prepares for what is to follow; this time a minuet is
      played, which is heard entire, for as long as the window remains open the
      orchestra is silent, and conversation is carried on parlando. The unusual
      treatment of this scene prepares the way for the ball; but it is quite as
      consistent with the adagio which intervenes with surprising and profound
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p208.png">[208]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave and elevated tone betokening the presence of higher moral forces
      is additionally impressive after the unquiet, passionate activity which
      precedes it. For the first time in this finale the voices put forth all
      their power and beauty, and they receive powerful assistance from the
      accompanying wind instruments. The voices seem to stand out from the dark
      background of the peculiarly deep notes of the clarinets, but the chords
      which follow are like gleams of light cast upon them, and the whole
      movement appears transfigured in the glory of a higher region. The scene
      changes, as was not unusual in finales, and we find ourselves in the
      ball-room. The dance ended, the guests disperse for refreshment, and Don
      Giovanni and Leporello, as hosts, Zerlina unable to escape Don Giovanni's
      observation, and Masetto, jealously watching her, come to the front. The
      orchestra plays the principal part in the lively movement, 6-8, which
      portrays this situation. Rhythm, melodies, and instrumental colouring, all
      are stamped with voluptuous excitement, and we seem to breathe the heated
      air of the ball-room. The voices move freely, either joining in the
      orchestral subjects or going their own way in easy parlando or prominent
      melodies, grouped according to the requirements of the situation. The
      entrance of the masks gives, as has already been observed, a different
      tone to the scene; the stranger guests are courteously greeted, and Don
      Giovanni's summons to the dance places fully before the spectators the
      ball-room scene, which has so often been suggested. The real motive of the
      scene being musical, the dramatic representation is skilfully made the
      object of the musical construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company is a mixed one, and different dances are arranged to suit the
      taste of all; thus also Don Giovanni is provided with the means of freeing
      himself of those persons who come in the way of his design. His
      distinguished guests tread a minuet, he himself joins in the country dance
      with Zerlina, while Leporello whirls Masetto in the giddy waltz. The
      musical representation of the situation in the three different dances is
      thus made the chief point of the scene, the plot moving rapidly onward;
      none of the characters <span class="side">DANCES.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p209.png">[209]</a></span> are in a
      position to express themselves fully, and the dance alone preserves the
      continuity of the whole. The combination of three dances simultaneously in
      varied rhythm and expression, offered to Mozart a task in counterpoint
      which he has accomplished with so much ease and certainty, that the
      untechnical listener scarcely believes in its difficulty. The arithmetical
      calculation that three bars in 2-4 are equal to two bars in 3-4, and one
      bar 3-8 represents a crotchet in a triplet, is easily made, and the system
      presents no difficulty. But the problem really consists in concealing the
      system beneath the melody and rhythm, and in causing the necessary
      coincidence of the phrasing to appear a natural and unstudied one,
      dependent on the individual character of each dance. One dance follows
      another as a matter of course. The minuet begins&mdash;the same which has
      been heard before. At the repetition of the second part, the second
      orchestra prepares to strike up, the open strings are struck in fifths,
      touched <i>pizzicato</i>, and little shakes tried, the violoncello joins
      in in the same way&mdash;and all falls naturally into the minuet, as it
      pursues its even course.<a href="#linknote38-181" name="linknoteref38-181"
      id="linknoteref38-181"> 181 </a> At last a gay country dance (2-4) strikes
      up, as different in melody and rhythm from the minuet as can be, although
      it is of course constructed on the same fundamental bass. At the second
      part, the third orchestra proceeds to tune up as the second had done
      before, and falls in with a fresh and merry waltz (3-8).<a
      href="#linknote38-182" name="linknoteref38-182" id="linknoteref38-182">
      182 </a> Before the minuet recommences, Zerlina's cry for help is heard,
      both dances and music break off suddenly, and the orchestra, which has
      hitherto been silent, strikes in with full force.<a href="#linknote38-183"
      name="linknoteref38-183" id="linknoteref38-183"> 183 </a> Zerlina's cry
      for help brings about a complete change of <span class="side">DON
      GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p210.png">[210]</a></span>
      mood and tone. All present, except Don Giovanni and Leporello, are
      inspired by one sentiment, and form a compact and solid mass opposing the
      two, either in unison or by means of a purely harmonious treatment of the
      voices. Only pit particular points, such as the unmasking, do the
      different characters stand out, and the imitation by means of which the
      parts are again united emphasises the impression of strict connection
      between them. This kind of grouping requires a broad, grand treatment, and
      a more forcible one both for the voices and the orchestra. Mozart has
      nevertheless happily avoided the adoption of a tragic tone, which would
      have been unsuited to the situation. The case is not, after all, too grave
      to allow of Don Giovanni and Leporello expressing their confusion and
      dismay comically, after their manner, and the humorous character of the
      opera is thereby preserved.<a href="#linknote38-184"
      name="linknoteref38-184" id="linknoteref38-184"> 184 </a> Still more
      simple is the construction of the second finale. The introduction of table
      music taken from different operas renders the supper scene a very
      masterpiece of musical fun; but the episode has no direct connection with
      the action.<a href="#linknote38-185" name="linknoteref38-185"
      id="linknoteref38-185"> 185 </a> This begins with the entrance of Elvira,
      with a gravity and an impulse which have been wanting since the beginning
      of the opera. In opposition to Elvira's glowing passion, to which her
      higher resolves lend nobler impulse than before, so that even Leporello is
      carried away by her energy, Don Giovanni's sensuality stands out in
      stronger relief, until it outrages man's noblest and most sacred feelings;
      the contradiction develops a depth of pathos <span class="side">THE SECOND
      FINALE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p211.png">[211]</a></span>
      which prepares for the approaching catastrophe. The force and fulness of
      musical expression in this scene are as remarkable as the deep truth of
      its characterisation. Compare the passionate expressions of Donna Anna
      with this outbreak of Elvira, and the fundamental difference of the two
      characters is clear; so also it is plain that, inimical to each other as
      they may be, Elvira and Don Giovanni are creatures of the same mould,
      having the same easily excited sensual impulses. Leporello's
      terror-stricken announcement of the Commendatore's approach comes as a
      relief to this highly wrought scene. In point of fact, the comic tone
      increases the suspense more than even Elvira's piercing cry; ludicrous as
      is the fear of Leporello, the main impression it produces is one of horror
      at its cause. The first fear-struck tones of the orchestra, collecting
      their forces for what is to come, the first simple, firm tones of the
      spectre's voice<a href="#linknote38-186" name="linknoteref38-186"
      id="linknoteref38-186"> 186 </a> transport us to the sphere of the
      marvellous. This sense of the supernatural is preserved by Mozart
      throughout the scene, and the hearer seems to himself to be standing in
      breathless suspense at the very verge of the abyss. It is produced by an
      uninterrupted climax of characteristically shaded movement; and the object
      which the master has kept steadily before him has been to produce at every
      point the expression of a grandeur and sublimity surpassing that of earth.
      To accomplish this, external means, such as the disposition of harmonies
      and instrumental colouring are employed with equal boldness and skill, but
      the true conditions of its extra-ordinary effect are the high conception
      and powerful inspiration which animate the whole. When to this it is added
      that Don Giovanni and Leporello, although under the spell of the
      supernatural apparition, act freely, each according to his individual
      nature, without for an instant prejudicing the unity of tone, it must be
      acknowledged that the union of dramatic truth and lofty ideal is here
      complete. After this prolonged and painful suspense the breaking of the
      storm <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p212.png">[212]</a></span> which is to deliver Don Giovanni
      into the power of the internal spirits comes as a long-expected
      catastrophe. The spirits themselves Mozart has wisely kept in the
      background. Invisible in the darkness, they summon their victim in few,
      monotonous, but appalling notes. This allows of a more animated expression
      to the torture of despair which seizes Don Giovanni, and to the terror of
      Leporello; while the orchestra depicts the tumult of all the powers of
      nature. This scene can only attain to its full effect when theatrical
      managers can make up their minds to allow the music to work on the
      imagination and feeling of the audience, unimpeded by a display of
      fireworks and demoniac masks.<a href="#linknote38-187"
      name="linknoteref38-187" id="linknoteref38-187"> 187 </a> This finale,
      after all that has preceded it, does not certainly produce a calming
      effect, but it relieves the suspense, and virtually brings the plot to an
      end. The entrance of the other characters to learn the fate of Don
      Giovanni from Leporello, and to satisfy the audience as to their own fate,
      is chiefly a concession to the custom of assembling all the chief persons
      on the stage at the close of the opera, which in this case seems justified
      by the necessity of concluding with a composing and moral impression. It
      is not, however, the true close of the plot, and the audience have already
      been quite sufficiently informed as to the fate of the characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarded from a musical point of view, Leporello's narrative&mdash;interrupted
      by exclamations of astonishment from the others&mdash;is very fresh and
      spirited, and the surprise well and delicately expressed; the movement
      would be most effective in another place, but here it falls decidedly
      flat. The larghetto in which the duet between Don Ottavio and Donna Anna,
      with the short remarks of the others, is brought to a close is lovely, but
      not so weighty in substance as the situation demands. The closing movement
      is very fine, and Mozart has imparted such a clear and tender radiance to
      the church-music sort of form in which he has embodied the moral maxims,
      that a flush like that of dawn seems to rise <span class="side">THE SECOND
      FINALE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p213.png">[213]</a></span>
      from the gloomy horror which has buried the gay life of the drama in
      deepest night. It was soon felt that to preserve the interest of the
      audience after the spirit scene was impossible. An attempt at abbreviation
      was annexed to the original score, omitting the larghetto so far as it
      referred to personal circumstances. Whether this experiment was made in
      Prague or Vienna,<a href="#linknote38-188" name="linknoteref38-188"
      id="linknoteref38-188"> 188 </a> it appears not to have sufficed, and at
      the performance in Vienna the opera closed, as it almost invariably has
      later, with Don Giovanni's descent into the lower regions. At his fall all
      the characters enter and give a cry of horror, which is inserted in the
      score on the chord of D major. A few attempts have been made later, either
      on theoretical or practical grounds, to restore the original closing
      scene.<a href="#linknote38-189" name="linknoteref38-189"
      id="linknoteref38-189"> 189 </a> Attempts at a modification such as have
      been made are very objectionable. At a performance in Paris Don Giovanni's
      disappearance was followed by the entry of Donna Anna's corpse borne by
      mourners, and the chanting of the "Dies iræ" from Mozart's Requiem.<a
      href="#linknote38-190" name="linknoteref38-190" id="linknoteref38-190">
      190 </a> This idea suggested to Kugler<a href="#linknote38-191"
      name="linknoteref38-191" id="linknoteref38-191"> 191 </a> the further one
      of changing the scene after Don Giovanni's fall to the mausoleum of the
      Commendatore, and introducing the funeral ceremonies, the chorus singing
      from Mozart's Re-queim, "Lux perpetua luceat ei" (not <i>eis</i>, "because
      it is only for one person"), "Domine, cum sanctis tuis quia pius es," to
      be followed by the "Osanna in excelsis" as an appropriate conclusion. It
      is as difficult to comprehend how these two movements can be thus
      combined, as how reverence for the master can allow of his sacred music
      being thus tacked on to an opera without any regard to unity of style and
      workmanship. Viol, supported by Wolzogen, adopted this idea so far as,
      instead of the usual conclusion, to insert the funeral service in the
      mausoleum, and have the closing movement of the opera sung there; but it
      appears <span class="side">DON GIOVANNI.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p214.png">[214]</a></span> altogether out of place. Nothing
      can be more objectionable than to make use of separate parts of a work of
      art in a different sense to that intended by the master; omission is, on
      the whole, a less hurtful proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consideration of the finale proves what is borne out by the whole opera,
      that, though inferior in artistic unity of plot to "Figaro," it excels
      that work in the musical nature of its situations and moods. In "Figaro"
      we are amazed to find how, within the narrow limits of emotion presented
      to us, seldom rising to passion, never to a higher pathos, our minds are
      entranced by the grace and spirit of the representation. In "Don
      Giovanni," on the contrary, there is scarcely a side of human nature which
      is not expressed in the most varied shades of individuality and situation;
      through the checkered scenes of daily life we are led to the very gates of
      the spirit world, and the light of original wit and humour shines upon the
      work from beginning to end. The difficulty for a dramatically gifted
      author lay in moderation. Da Ponte having placed his "Don Giovanni" in the
      present, Mozart with ready wit draws upon reality where-ever possible for
      matters of detail and colouring. This freshness and fulness of realism
      distinguishes "Don Giovanni" from "Figaro," without entailing any loss of
      ideality, for every subject drawn from real life is turned to the service
      of the artistic conception of the whole. The statues of the Parthenon or
      the figures of Raphael teach how the great masters of the formative arts
      follow nature in all and each of their creations; they teach, too, how the
      treasure which the eye of genius descries in the depths of nature must be
      first received into a human heart, thence to emerge as a complete and
      self-contained whole, appealing to the sympathies of all mankind. Nor is
      it otherwise with the great masters of sound, whatever be the impulse
      which urges them to expression, whether the words of the poet, the
      experiences of life, the impressions of form, colour, or sound;
    </p>
    <p>
      the idea of the whole, which inspires it with life and endows it with form
      and meaning, must come from the depths of his own spirit, and is the
      creative force, which is unceasingly active until the perfect work of art
      is produced. The ideal <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p215.png">[215]</a></span>
      of such a work is the perfection which is conceivable and visible to
      mankind in art alone; in it that which elsewhere appears as contrast or
      opposition rises to the highest unity. This once attained, we experience
      the satisfaction which for mortals exists in art alone. But our delight
      and admiration rise still higher when this harmony is maintained
      throughout a varied and many-sided composition, containing a wealth of
      interests and motives appealing to our most opposite sympathies, and
      stirring the very depths of our being&mdash;then it is that we feel the
      full and immediate inspiration of that Spirit Who looks upon the universe
      as the artist looks upon his work.

      FROM a practical point of view, Mozart's "Don Giovanni" did no more than
      his "Figaro" towards improving his position in Vienna. His painful
      pecuniary circumstances may be gathered from his letters to Puchberg in
      June, 1788. A glance at the catalogue of his compositions after his return
      from Prague is sufficient to indicate the fact of their having been
      produced at the pleasure of pupils or patrons:&mdash;

      The symphonies in E flat major, G minor, and C major, written in the three
      summer months of 1788, show that the inner strength was not slumbering;
      but Mozart's appointment as chamber-composer to the Emperor gave him no
      impulse to composition, and his official duties were limited to the
      preparation of music for the masked balls in the imperial Redoutensale.<a

    <p>
      These Redoutensale are situated in the wing of the Hof-burg, which forms
      the right side of the Josephsplatz, and originally contained a theatre,
      where, upon festive occasions, operas and ballets were performed before
      the court; after the erection of the Burgtheater, in 1752, the old
      Hoftheater was <span class="side">MASKED BALLS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p217.png">[217]</a></span> converted
      into the large and small Redoutensaal now existing, and concerts, balls,
      and other entertainments given there. The balls were masked, and took
      place on every Carnival Sunday, on Shrove-Tuesday, and on the three last
      days of Carnival. Joseph II. favoured them as a means of drawing different
      classes together, and frequently appeared at them with his court; all
      ranks mixed freely, and considerable license was allowed. The usual dances
      were minuets, country dances, and waltzes, in the last of which only the
      lower classes joined, on account of the crowding&mdash;just as is the case
      in "Don Giovanni" (p. 163). The management of the Redoute was generally in
      the same hands as that of the Opera-Theatre, the two being farmed out
      together. The court monopolised the Opera-Theatre in 1778 and the
      Kàrnthnerthortheater in 1785, and kept the control over them until August,
      1794. Thus it came about that the court theatrical-director ordered the
      dance music, and although the pay was only a few ducats for a set of
      dances, the services of good composers were claimed for the purpose;
      Haydn, Eybler, Gyrowetz, Hummel, and Beethoven all composed for the
      Redoute, as well as Mozart.<a href="#linknote39-3" name="linknoteref39-3"

      No dances are chronicled in 1790, the illness and subsequent death of the
      Emperor (February 20) having doubtless put a temporary stop to such
      entertainments. Those in the list are for the most part composed for full
      orchestra, and those with which I am acquainted make no claim to be
      considered otherwise than as actual dance music, with pleasing melodies
      and fresh rhythm&mdash;innocent recreations, betraying the master's hand
      in touches here and there.<a href="#linknote39-6" name="linknoteref39-6"
      id="linknoteref39-6"> 6 </a> As the only musical task imposed upon him by
      virtue of his office, they might well give rise to his bitter remark that
      his salary was too high for what he did, too low for what he could do
      (Vol. II., p. 276).

      A commission more worthy his fame was intrusted to him by Van Swieten,
      who, having brought with him from Berlin an enthusiastic admiration for
      Handel's oratorios, sought to introduce them in Vienna. He not only gave
      frequent concerts at his residence in the Renngasse, for the exclusive
      performance of classical music, but he arranged grand performances of
      Handel's oratorios, supported by all the vocal and instrumental forces at
      his command. He induced several art-loving noblemen (among them the
      Princes Schwarzen-berg, Lobkowitz, and Dietrichstein, Counts Appony,
      Batthiany, Franz Esterhazy, &amp;c.) to cover by a subscription the cost
      of these performances. They took place generally in <span class="side">ARRANGEMENT
      OF HANDEL'S ORATORIOS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p219.png">[219]</a></span> the great hall of the Court
      Library (of which Van Swieten was chief director); sometimes at the palace
      of one or other of the patrons, and always in the afternoon, by daylight.
      There was no charge for admission, the audience being invited guests. The
      performances were arranged according to circumstances, taking place
      generally in the spring, before the nobility left Vienna for their country
      estates. The performers were principally members of the Court-Kapelle and
      of the operatic orchestra, and the preparation was undertaken entirely by
      Van Swieten, in whose house the rehearsals took place. He himself arranged
      "Athalia," and very probably also "The Choice of Hercules," for a
      performance after Mozart's death. The conductorship was at first intrusted
      to Joseph Starzer, who had arranged "Judas Maccabæus";<a
      href="#linknote39-7" name="linknoteref39-7" id="linknoteref39-7"> 7 </a>
      after his death, on April 22, 1787, Mozart took his place, and young

      "Acisand Galatea" was first performed, Mozart's arrangement of it

      her by this performance.<a href="#linknote39-9" name="linknoteref39-9"

      </a> on May 30,1788. Finally, in July, 1790, Mozart arranged the "Ode for
      St. Cecilia's Day" and the "Feast of Alexander." It was considered
      necessary, in order not to distract the attention of the public by the
      unusual effects of Handel's orchestra, to modify the instrumentation.<a
      href="#linknote39-15" name="linknoteref39-15" id="linknoteref39-15"> 15
      </a> Even Hiller remarks (Nachricht, p. 14), "Many improvements may be
      made in Handel's compositions by the employment of the wind instruments,
      according to the fashion of the present day. In the whole of the
      'Messiah,' Handel appears never to have thought of the oboes, flutes, or
      French horns, all of which are so often employed to heighten or strengthen
      the effect in our present orchestras. I need not remark that the
      alterations must be made with care and discretion." But he went far beyond
      these "innocent" views; he shortened and altered the composition itself,
      especially in the airs and recitatives, and wrote "an entirely new score,
      as far as may be what Handel would himself have written at the present
      day" (Betracht-ungen, p. 16). He was convinced that "only a pedantic lover
      of old fashions, or a pedantic contemner of what is good in the new ones"
      would find fault with this proceeding (Betracht-ungen, p. 18). The object
      with which Mozart undertook to rearrange the instrumentation of Handel's
      works was the strengthening and enriching of the orchestra to enable it to
      dispense with the organ or harpsichord, to which the working-out of the
      harmonies had originally been intrusted. This was principally effected by
      the introduction of wind <span class="side">ARRANGEMENT OF HANDEL'S
      ORATORIOS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p221.png">[221]</a></span>
      instruments. Mozart's autograph scores of "Acis and Galatea" (566 K.), of
      "The Ode for St. Cecilia's Day" (592 K.),<a href="#linknote39-16"
      name="linknoteref39-16" id="linknoteref39-16"> 16 </a> and of the "Feast
      of Alexander" (591 K.),<a href="#linknote39-17" name="linknoteref39-17"
      id="linknoteref39-17"> 17 </a> preserved in the Royal Library in Berlin,
      show how he set about his task. The voice parts and stringed instruments
      have been transferred to his score, and left as Handel wrote them, with
      the exception that where Handel has provided a violin part, Mozart employs
      the second violin and viola to fill in the harmonies. The wind instruments
      have been altogether omitted by the copyist in order to leave Mozart free
      play. Wherever Handel has employed them characteristically, they are so
      preserved, but when, as often happens, the oboes are the sole
      representatives of the wind instruments, Mozart has proceeded
      independently, sometimes replacing them by other single instruments,
      frequently clarinets&mdash;flutes only very occasionally, sometimes
      introducing the whole body of wind instruments. This he does also in some
      places where Handel has not even employed oboes, if it is needed to give
      force or fulness to the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frequent introduction of the clarinets replaced the full and powerful
      organ tones, but without any express imitation of that particular
      sound-effect by Mozart. The whole character of the instrumentation was
      necessarily modified, and even the portions which were literally <span
      class="side">OFFICIAL AND OCCASIONAL WORKS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p222.png">[222]</a></span> transcribed from Handel's
      original have a very different effect in their altered surroundings.
      Mozart has proceeded quite as independently in dealing with the
      harpsichord parts. Not content with filling in the prescribed or suggested
      harmonies and regulating the due succession of chords, he has also made an
      independent disposition of the middle parts and given them free movement.
      The subjects employed by Handel are further developed, and sometimes a new
      motif has occurred to him as an enlivenment to the accompaniment, in which
      case the additional wind instruments are employed to advantage. The
      harpsichord is treated, in the main, as might be expected from a
      first-rate organist of that time, and it is difficult at the present day
      to reproduce what so much depends upon the free co-operation of the
      performer.<a href="#linknote39-18" name="linknoteref39-18"
      id="linknoteref39-18"> 18 </a> The objection which may be raised against
      the alteration and partial remodelling of a carefully thought-out and
      finished work by a strange hand is unanswerable. The most loving and
      intelligent treatment cannot avoid inequality and incongruity; compared
      with what has been literally transmitted, every modification reflects,
      both in kind and degree, the individual learning and taste of the adapter.
      On the whole, however, Mozart's arrangements evince the greatest reverence
      for Handel, combined with a masterly use of all available resources, and
      they afford a proof as interesting as it is instructive of the study which
      Mozart had bestowed upon Handel, of the spirit in which he undertook his
      task, and of his thorough and delicate apprehension of foreign creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart had heard the "Messiah" in 1777 at Mannheim, but apparently it had
      made no more lasting impression upon him than upon the public. Now,
      however, he approached the masterpiece with far other predilections, and
      the adaptation opened to him many points of interest. The three oratorios
      already mentioned were so moderate in length as to be suited for
      performance entire, but the greatly <span class="side">THE "MESSIAH."</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p223.png">[223]</a></span>
      disproportionate length of the "Messiah" made its curtailment a necessary
      part of its adaptation (572 K.). Several pieces were omitted, and others
      were shortened; but a proof that other and more important alterations were
      contemplated is afforded by a letter from Van Swieten to Mozart (March 21,
      1789), given by Niemetschek (p. 46): "Your idea of turning the words of
      the unimpassioned air into a recitative is excellent; and in case you
      should not have retained the words, I have copied and now send them to
      you. The musician who is able to adapt and to amplify Handel's work so
      reverently and so judiciously, that on the one side he satisfies modern
      taste, and on the other preserves the integrity of his subject, has
      appreciated the great master's work, has penetrated to the source of his
      inspiration, and will doubtless draw from the same well himself. It is
      thus that I regard what you have accomplished, and I need not therefore
      again assure you of my entire confidence, but only beg you to let me have
      the recitative as soon as possible." Nevertheless, this idea, judging from
      the published score, was not carried out. In the arrangement of the
      orchestra, Mozart has gone further than in the previous works. Sometimes
      there has been an external necessity for altering even characteristic
      instrumentation, as in the air, "The trumpet shall sound" (No. 44). There
      were no solo trumpeters such as existed in Handel's time, and an attempt
      was made to preserve the effect as far as possible by rearrangement. He
      has altered, however, even without such occasion as this, and many
      instances of instrumental arrangement might be cited as far transgressing
      the bounds within which interference with a work of art is justifiable.<a
      href="#linknote39-19" name="linknoteref39-19" id="linknoteref39-19"> 19
      </a> In themselves these same portions are admirable alike in their
      sound-effects and musical treatment, and in the delicate discrimination
      with which Mozart has made his additions appear as the natural development
      of Handel's ideas; we can see how the fascination of continuing the
      weaving of the threads from the master's hands has tempted <span
      class="side">OFFICIAL AND OCCASIONAL WORKS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p224.png">[224]</a></span> him to overstep the boundary. In
      doing so, however, the connection of the parts has been lost, and the
      unity of the whole has been disturbed. One of the most remarkable examples
      is the air, "The people that walked in darkness," in which the wind
      instruments added by Mozart are foreign to Handel's purpose, but
      nevertheless of very fine effect, and certainly not deserving of the
      reproach of "doleful sound-painting" ("betrübter Malerei").<a
      href="#linknote39-20" name="linknoteref39-20" id="linknoteref39-20"> 20
      </a> It was to be expected that Mozart's adaptation should attract both
      praise<a href="#linknote39-21" name="linknoteref39-21"
      id="linknoteref39-21"> 21 </a> and blame,<a href="#linknote39-22"

      name="linknoteref39-24" id="linknoteref39-24"> 24 </a> who went deeper
      into the subject found much that was excellent and also much that was
      faulty in the work, at the same time that they gave due consideration to
      the occasion that called it forth and the design with which it was
      undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be forgotten that these adaptations were undertaken by Mozart
      solely for Van Swieten's performances, and that his individual taste and
      the exigences of the representation must have exercised considerable
      influence upon them. He must certainly not be credited with the wish to
      improve upon Handel;<a href="#linknote39-25" name="linknoteref39-25"
      id="linknoteref39-25"> 25 </a> his intention has rather been so to
      popularise his works as to bring them home to the <span class="side">ADAPTATIONS
      OF EARLIER WORKS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p225.png">[225]</a></span>
      public, without altering any of the more important parts. That the
      adaptations should have been published and accepted as regular improved
      editions of the original was not his fault, though he has often had to do
      penance for it. It must be remembered also that the historic theory which
      holds that every work of art should be carefully preserved in the form
      wherein its author has embodied it was then non-existent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of compositions have been directly the result of
      circumstances determining the direction of the artist's energies; they
      laboured for the future while seeking to satisfy the present. They
      therefore made free use of their works for subsequent elaboration,
      altering what was needful, and adapting them to the particular occasions
      on which they were performed by means of additions, omissions, and
      alterations. The same freedom was thought allowable with the works of
      other masters, especially those of an earlier time, so that the public
      might the more easily and comfortably enjoy what was set before it. A
      knowledge of what was then thought excusable in this direction<a
      href="#linknote39-26" name="linknoteref39-26" id="linknoteref39-26"> 26
      </a> will serve to increase our respect for the artistic spirit in which
      Mozart performed his task.<a href="#linknote39-27" name="linknoteref39-27"
      id="linknoteref39-27"> 27 </a> The scientific and historic ideas which
      have permeated the cultivation of our times require the enjoyment of a
      work of art to be founded upon historical insight and appreciation, and to
      this end it must be represented exactly as the artist has produced it. But
      this principle, true as it is in itself, can only be applied with
      considerable practical limitations, and it is doubtful how far the general
      public is capable of apprehending and approving it; in any case it is much
      to be desired that the fashion in such matters should not be set by
      pedants.<a href="#linknote39-28" name="linknoteref39-28"

      CHAPTER XL. A PROFESSIONAL TOUR.

      MOZART'S unsatisfactory position in Vienna, both from a pecuniary and a
      professional point of view,<a href="#linknote40-1" name="linknoteref40-1"
      id="linknoteref40-1"> 1 </a> doubtless inclined him for a professional
      tour, to which the immediate inducement was an invitation from Prince Karl
      Lichnowsky, husband of the Countess Thun, a zealous musical connoisseur
      and a pupil and ardent admirer of Mozart. His estates in Schleswig and his
      position in the Prussian army necessitated his residence from time to time
      in Berlin; and, being on the point of repairing thither in the spring of
      1789, he invited Mozart to accompany him. The musical taste and liberality
      of Frederick William II. augured well for the expedition, and Lichnowsky's
      support was likely to prove a valuable aid. Accordingly on April 8, 1789,
      they set out.<a href="#linknote40-2" name="linknoteref40-2"
      id="linknoteref40-2"> 2 </a> At Prague, where they remained only one day,
      a contract with Guardasoni for an opera to be written in the autumn was
      "almost settled"; unfortunately only <i>almost</i>, for it does not appear
      to have gone further. Mozart was especially delighted with the news
      brought to him from Berlin by his old friend Ramm, that the King, having
      been informed of his intended visit, had asked repeatedly if the plan was
      likely to be carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Dresden, where they arrived on April 12, Mozart's first care was to
      seek out his friend Madame Duschek, who was visiting the Neumann family;
      he was soon quite at home with these "charming people." Joh. Leop.
      Neumann, Secretary to the Military Council, was highly esteemed for his
      literary and musical activity. He translated for his intimate friend
      Naumann the operas "Cora" and <span class="side">DRESDEN, 1789.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p227.png">[227]</a></span>
      "Amphion," and in 1777 he founded a musical academy;<a href="#linknote40-3"
      name="linknoteref40-3" id="linknoteref40-3"> 3 </a> his wife was
      considered a first-rate pianoforte-player.<a href="#linknote40-4"
      name="linknoteref40-4" id="linknoteref40-4"> 4 </a> Through them Mozart
      was introduced to the musical world of Dresden&mdash;among others to
      Körner, an interesting proof of whose friendship remains in a crayon
      sketch of Mozart drawn by Komer's sister-in-law, Dora Stock, in 1789.
      Kapellmeister Naumann&mdash;a Mass composed by whom he heard and thought
      very "mediocre"&mdash;inspired him with instantaneous dislike; and the
      feeling appears to have been mutual, if, as tradition reports, Naumann
      used to call Mozart a musical <i>sans culotte</i>.<a href="#linknote40-5"
      name="linknoteref40-5" id="linknoteref40-5"> 5 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A summons to play before the court on April 14 was regarded as an unusual
      honour, and was followed by a present of 100 ducats.<a href="#linknote40-6"
      name="linknoteref40-6" id="linknoteref40-6"> 6 </a> Elsewhere he played
      with his usual readiness and good nature; and the interest which was felt
      in him was increased by a competition in which he came off with flying
      colours. His rival was Hàssler of Erfurt,<a href="#linknote40-7"
      name="linknoteref40-7" id="linknoteref40-7"> 7 </a> who happened to be in
      Dresden at the time, and was considered a pianoforte and organ-player of
      the first rank. Much was said in praise of his astonishing executive
      powers, of his brilliant and fiery delivery,<a href="#linknote40-8"
      name="linknoteref40-8" id="linknoteref40-8"> 8 </a> of his singular gift
      "of putting expression into the most rapid prestissimo&mdash;so that in
      softness and pathos it was equal to an adagio"<a href="#linknote40-9"
      name="linknoteref40-9" id="linknoteref40-9"> 9 </a>&mdash;and of his
      wonderful memory, enabling him to play the most difficult compositions
      without the notes. As an organ-player his dexterity with the pedal was
      specially admired.<a href="#linknote40-10" name="linknoteref40-10"
      id="linknoteref40-10"> 10 </a> He had an <span class="side">A PROFESSIONAL
      TOUR.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p228.png">[228]</a></span>
      excellent opinion of himself; and when in the summer of 1788 he was in
      Dresden, "exciting the liveliest astonishment in all who heard him by his
      inexpressibly affecting playing," he let it be known that he intended to
      proceed to Vienna, "in order to prove to the Vienna public in competition
      with the great Mozart, that strong as the latter may be upon the
      pianoforte, he cannot play the clavichord."<a href="#linknote40-11"
      name="linknoteref40-11" id="linknoteref40-11"> 11 </a> To Mozart he
      appeared no formidable antagonist; he gave him credit for his dexterity in
      the use of the pedal, but placed him below Albrechtsberger as an
      organ-player, and compared him to Aurnhammer as a pianist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's visit to Leipzig left behind a strong and pleasant impression.
      Fr. Rochlitz, then a young man, became intimate with him at the house of
      their common friend Doles,<a href="#linknote40-12" name="linknoteref40-12"
      id="linknoteref40-12"> 12 </a> and preserved a number of interesting
      traits, characteristic both of the man and the artist. He was cheerful and
      amiable in society, outspoken in his judgments of art and artists, and
      responsive to any display of interest in music; "not niggardly of his art,
      as so many musicians are." Almost every evening during his stay in Leipzig
      he took part in musical entertainments at different houses, and when
      quartets were played he took the piano or tenor part. The violinist
      Berger, who was generally of the party, used, as an old man, when any of
      these pieces were brought forward, to whisper to a friend with tender
      emotion, "Ah, I had once the honour of accompanying the great Mozart
      himself in that piece."<a href="#linknote40-13" name="linknoteref40-13"
      id="linknoteref40-13"> 13 </a> An ear-witness gave the following account:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On April 22 he played the organ of the Thomaskirche, without previous
      notice, and gratuitously. He played very finely for an hour to a large
      audience. The then organist, Gorner, and the cantor, Doles, sat near him
      and pulled the stops. I saw him well; a young, well-dressed man of middle
      height. Doles was quite delighted with the performance, and declared that
      his old master, Sebastian Bach, had <span class="side">LEIPZIG&mdash;POTSDAM,
      1789.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p229.png">[229]</a></span>
      risen again. Mozart brought to bear all the arts of harmony with the
      greatest ease and discrimination, and improvised magnificently on every
      theme given&mdash;among others on the chorale, "Jesu meine Zuversicht."<a
      href="#linknote40-14" name="linknoteref40-14" id="linknoteref40-14"> 14
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Doles in return made his Thomaner scholars sing for Mozart Bach's motett,
      "Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied," and we have already seen how intensely
      delighted he was, and how eagerly he at once set about studying Bach's
      other motetts (Vol. II., p. 416). Shortly after this, and apparently
      without having given a concert, Mozart continued his journey to Berlin,
      and thence immediately proceeded to Potsdam, where Lichnowsky presented
      him to the King. Frederick William II. possessed remarkable talent and
      love for music. He played the violoncello well, not only as a soloist, but
      frequently also in the orchestra at rehearsals.<a href="#linknote40-15"
      name="linknoteref40-15" id="linknoteref40-15"> 15 </a> Even before his
      accession to the throne he had maintained a well-appointed and excellent
      Kapelle under the leadership of the violoncellist Duport senior
      (1741-1818); concerts were regularly performed before him, and he was fond
      of hearing foreign virtuosi.<a href="#linknote40-16"
      name="linknoteref40-16" id="linknoteref40-16"> 16 </a> Reichardt credits
      him with great universality of taste,<a href="#linknote40-17"
      name="linknoteref40-17" id="linknoteref40-17"> 17 </a> which was of
      special advantage to music after Frederick the Great's bigoted prejudice.
      It was at the King's instigation that Reichardt organised his Concerts
      Spirituels, at which the older Italian music was principally performed; he
      esteemed highly both Handel and Gluck, and both at his concerts and on the
      stage showed equal favour to Italian, French, and German music; the
      improved instrumental music called into being by Haydn found a sympathetic
      patron in him. After his accession, in 1786, musical enterprise had still
      more cause to rejoice in the royal favour. He united his own with the
      royal Kapelle and placed Reichardt as Kapellmeister at their head. The
      grand Italian opera given at the Carnival was brilliantly appointed, and
      Naumann's services as a composer were retained, together with those of
      Alessandri <span class="side">A PROFESSIONAL TOUR.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p230.png">[230]</a></span> and
      Reichardt. The hitherto little-esteemed German drama was elevated to the
      rank of a national theatre, and a regular support was secured to it, which
      had great weight in the elevation of German opera. Nor were opera buffa or
      the French opera neglected; on one evening, during a court festival, in
      the summer of 1789, Cimarosa's "Falegname," Dalayrac's "Nina," and
      Reichardt's "Claudine von Villa-bella" were performed. The King's concerts
      were conducted in the same manner as before, remaining under Duport's
      leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King welcomed foreign artists not only liberally in point of payment,
      but with the utmost kindness and freedom of personal intercourse, so that
      it is not surprising that they should have held him in great reverence,
      and approached him with large expectations.<a href="#linknote40-18"
      name="linknoteref40-18" id="linknoteref40-18"> 18 </a> Mozart's best
      introductions to the King's favour were his instrumental compositions,
      especially his quartets, and the very successful performance of his
      "Entführung" which had taken place in Berlin; there can be little doubt
      that he confirmed the good opinion conceived of him by his accomplishments
      as a virtuoso and by his general demeanour. But he found a powerful
      opponent in the haughty and intriguing Duport.<a href="#linknote40-19"
      name="linknoteref40-19" id="linknoteref40-19"> 19 </a> At Mozart's first
      visit he insisted on speaking French, which Mozart, although familiar with
      the language, decidedly declined doing. "The grinning mounseer," said he,
      "has been long enough making German money, and eating German bread, to be
      able to speak the German language, or to murder it as best he may, with
      his French grimaces."<a href="#linknote40-20" name="linknoteref40-20"
      id="linknoteref40-20"> 20 </a> Duport did not forgive him, and did all he
      could to prejudice the King against him, although Mozart paid him the
      compliment of composing variations (573 K.) to a charming minuet of
      Duport's (April 29, 1789), and of performing them himself. But the King
      was proof against <span class="side">OFFER OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p231.png">[231]</a></span>
      Duport's ill-nature, invited Mozart regularly to his concerts, and was
      fond of hearing him play. When he asked him what he thought of the Berlin
      Kapelle, Mozart answered frankly, that it contained the best performers in
      the world, but that if the gentlemen would play together it would be an
      improvement.<a href="#linknote40-21" name="linknoteref40-21"
      id="linknoteref40-21"> 21 </a> This implied disapprobation of the
      Kapellmeister Reichardt, whose direction had indeed been found fault with
      by others.<a href="#linknote40-22" name="linknoteref40-22"
      id="linknoteref40-22"> 22 </a> We hear of no intercourse between the two
      artists; perhaps some such sharp expressions as the above were the cause
      of the grudging notices of Mozart by Reichardt and the journals under his
      influence, which we cannot fail to remark.<a href="#linknote40-23"
      name="linknoteref40-23" id="linknoteref40-23"> 23 </a> No two natures
      could well be more dissimilar. Reichardt was undoubtedly a distinguished
      man; he had musical talent, a keen intellect, varied cultivation, and
      great energy; but ambition, vanity, and a passionate temper seldom allowed
      him to arrive at a calm judgment, and he was in continual search of some
      new way in which to bring himself forward. The journalist and the
      musician, the critic and the composer, trod close on each other's heels;
      and while always seeking to gain credit for originality of style, his
      greater compositions are in truth uncertain and unequal, and seldom
      produce the desired effect. No wonder that he failed to understand a
      nature such as Mozart's, which, undisturbed by external considerations,
      followed its creative impulses from sheer inner necessity; no wonder,
      either, that so failing, he should have sought to justify his aversion to
      his rival on polemical grounds.<a href="#linknote40-24"
      name="linknoteref40-24" id="linknoteref40-24"> 24 </a> Mozart's remark
      must have made some impression on the King, since he soon after offered
      him the post of Kapellmeister, with a salary of 3,000 dollars. This offer,
      however, consideration for the Emperor Joseph induced Mozart to decline.<a
      href="#linknote40-25" name="linknoteref40-25" id="linknoteref40-25"> 25
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A PROFESSIONAL TOUR.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p232.png">[232]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      During his stay in Potsdam, Mozart resided in the house of the well-known
      hom-player Thùrschmidt, with whom he had become acquainted in Paris; he
      was a constant guest also of the hospitable and music-loving Sartory, an
      artist of architectural ornament, who had been much in Italy, and welcomed
      all who took interest in his favourite art; Mozart's playing and
      sociability made him, as may be imagined, the centre of this cheerful
      society.<a href="#linknote40-26" name="linknoteref40-26"
      id="linknoteref40-26"> 26 </a> Another of his friends was the charming
      singer Sophie Niclas, sister to the Kammer-musikus Semler, who had made a
      very successful appearance as Constanze in the "Entführung" in 1784:<a
      href="#linknote40-27" name="linknoteref40-27" id="linknoteref40-27"> 27
      </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, at her house, he was asked to improvise something.
      Readily, as his custom was, he complied, and seated himself at the piano,
      having first been provided with two themes by the musicians who were
      present. Madame Niclas stood near his chair to watch him playing. Mozart,
      who loved a joke with her, looked up and said, "Come! haven't you a theme
      on your mind for me too?" She sang him one, and he began the most charming
      fantasia, now on the one subject, now on the other, ending by bringing
      them all three together, to the intense delight and amazement of all who
      were present.<a href="#linknote40-28" name="linknoteref40-28"
      id="linknoteref40-28"> 28 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrangements were made during Mozart's stay in Berlin for a return visit
      to Leipzig, where in the meantime a concert for his benefit was being
      organised; he arrived there on May 8. At the rehearsal for this concert he
      took the tempo of the first allegro of his symphony so fast that the
      orchestra was very soon in inextricable confusion. Mozart stopped, told
      the players what was wrong, and began again as fast as before, doing all
      he could to keep the orchestra together, and stamping the time with his
      foot so energetically that his steel shoe-buckle snapped in two.<a
      href="#linknote40-29" name="linknoteref40-29" id="linknoteref40-29"> 29
      </a> He laughed at this, and as they still dragged, he began a third time;
      the musicians, <span class="side">CONCERT IN LEIPZIG, 1789.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p233.png">[233]</a></span> grown
      impatient, worked in desperation, and at last it went right. "It was not
      caprice," he said afterwards to some musical friends, whom he had lectured
      only a short time before on the subject of too rapid tempo, "but I saw at
      once that most of the players were men advanced in years; there would have
      been no end to the dragging if I had not worked them up into a rage, so
      that they did their best out of pure spite." The rest of the symphony he
      took in moderate time, and after the song had been rehearsed he praised
      the accompaniment of the orchestra, and said that it would be unnecessary
      to rehearse his concerto: "The parts are correctly written out, you play
      accurately, and so do I"; and the result showed that his confidence was
      not misplaced.<a href="#linknote40-30" name="linknoteref40-30"
      id="linknoteref40-30"> 30 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The concert<a href="#linknote40-31" name="linknoteref40-31"
      id="linknoteref40-31"> 31 </a> was poorly attended, and scarcely paid the
      expenses of Mozart's journey to Leipzig. Almost half the audience had free
      tickets, which, with his usual liberality, Mozart gave away to every one
      he knew. He required no chorus, and the fairly numerous chorus-singers
      were therefore excluded from their usual free admission. Some of them
      inquired at the ticket-office whether this was really to be the case; and
      as soon as Mozart heard of the inquiry he gave orders that the good folks
      should all be admitted: "Who would think of enforcing such a rule?" The
      poor audience had not the effect of damping his musical enthusiasm or good
      humour. His own compositions only were performed; he conducted two
      symphonies, as yet unpublished, and then Madame Duschek sang the air
      composed for Storace with obbligato pianoforte (505 K.); he himself played
      two concertos, one of them the great C major (467 K.), as usual without
      notes. He complied with ready goodwill to the request for an improvisation
      at the close of the concert; and after it was over, as though he were then
      just warming to <span class="side">A PROFESSIONAL TOUR.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p234.png">[234]</a></span> his work, he
      took his friend Berger into his room and played far into the night.<a
      href="#linknote40-32" name="linknoteref40-32" id="linknoteref40-32"> 32
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart returned to Berlin<a href="#linknote40-33" name="linknoteref40-33"
      id="linknoteref40-33"> 33 </a> on May 19, and his "Entführung" was
      performed the same evening "by general desire."<a href="#linknote40-34"
      name="linknoteref40-34" id="linknoteref40-34"> 34 </a> He went to the
      theatre, seated himself close to the orchestra, and attracted the
      attention of his immediate neighbours by his <i>sotto voce</i> remarks on
      the performance. In Pedrillo's air at the words "nur ein feiger Tropf
      verzaget," the second violins played D sharp instead of D, whereupon
      Mozart angrily exclaimed, "Damn it, play D, will you!" Every one looked
      round astonished, and the orchestra recognised him. Madame Baranius, who
      was playing Blondchen, refused to make her exit until Mozart went on to
      the stage, complimented her, and promised to study the part with her
      himself.<a href="#linknote40-35" name="linknoteref40-35"
      id="linknoteref40-35"> 35 </a> This promise, according to old tradition in
      Berlin,<a href="#linknote40-36" name="linknoteref40-36"
      id="linknoteref40-36"> 36 </a> involved him in a questionable adventure.
      Henriette Baranius (<i>née</i> Husen) made her appearance at a very early
      age in Berlin in 1784, and became the darling of the public, more from her
      remarkable beauty and grace than from her talents as an actress and a
      singer, although these were by no means inconsiderable.<a
      href="#linknote40-37" name="linknoteref40-37" id="linknoteref40-37"> 37
      </a> She was much talked of, and the theatrical critics of the time were
      never tired of admiring her costly and tasteful dresses, which in defiance
      of all precedent she insisted upon wearing in parts to which they were

      Another and more innocent encounter took place in the <span class="side">LUDWIG

      theatre. Ludwig Tieck, as a youth, was frequently at the house of
      Reichardt, and there first began "to divine the mysteries of music in
      classical works":&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Led by his own inclination, and in opposition to the prevailing taste, he
      addicted himself to Mozart's great compositions, uninfluenced by
      contemporary critics, or even by so powerful an opinion as that of
      Reichardt. Mozart's victorious rival was Dittersdorf, whose comic operas
      were played in Berlin to crowded audiences. The "Doctor und Apotheker" was
      preferred to "Figaro" or "Don Juan," and "Die Liebe im Narrenhause" was in
      the public estimation the greatest of musical works. Ludwig's veneration
      for Mozart was destined to receive an unexpected reward. One evening
      during the year 1789, entering the theatre, as his custom was, long before
      the performance began, and while it was still empty and half-lighted, he
      perceived a strange man in the orchestra. He was short, quick, restless,
      and weak-eyed&mdash;an insignificant figure in a grey overcoat. He went
      from one desk to another, and appeared to be hastily looking through the
      music placed on them. Ludwig at once entered into conversation with him.
      They spoke of the orchestra, the theatre, the opera, the public taste. He
      expressed his opinions without reserve, and declared his enthusiastic
      admiration of Mozart's operas. "Do you really hear Mozart's works often,
      and love them?" asked the stranger&mdash;"that is very good of you, young
      sir." The conversation continued for some time longer; the theatre began
      to fill, and at last the stranger was called away from the stage. His talk
      had produced a singular effect upon Ludwig, who made inquiries concerning
      him, and learnt that it was Mozart himself, the great master, who had
      conversed with him, and expressed his obligation to him.<a

      Hummel, who, as Mozart's pupil, had played in Dresden on March 10 with
      great success,<a href="#linknote40-40" name="linknoteref40-40"
      id="linknoteref40-40"> 40 </a> was giving a concert in Berlin, without
      being aware of Mozart's presence. When the boy descried him among the
      audience, he could scarcely contain himself, and as soon as his piece was
      ended, he pushed his way through the audience and embraced him with the
      tenderest expressions of joy at seeing him.<a href="#linknote40-41"

      26, Mozart played before the Queen, which was considered a politic step,
      without any expectation of a handsome present in return. Following the
      advice of his friends, he did not attempt a public concert, seeing that
      there was no chance of a large profit, and the King was averse to it. The
      latter, however, sent him a present of 100 friedrichsdor, and expressed a
      wish that Mozart would write some quartets for him. This was the whole
      result of the tour, diminished by a loan of 100 florins which Mozart
      thought it incumbent on him to make to a friend; he might well write to
      his wife that she must be glad to see him, not the money he was bringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different was the career of Dittersdorf, who came to Berlin in July
      of the same year. He had chosen the time when the visit of the Governess
      of the Netherlands occasioned festivities of every kind, and he refreshed
      the memory of the King, who had seen and invited him at Breslau, by the
      presentation of six new symphonies. Immediately upon his arrival he
      managed to ingratiate himself with Reichardt, was by him presented to
      Madame Rietz, afterwards Countess Lichtenau, and was very soon commanded
      by the King to put his "Doctor und Apotheker" in rehearsal, and to conduct
      it at a court festival at Charlottenburg; he also received permission to
      produce his oratorio of "Job" in the opera-house (hitherto only used by
      the court), with the resources of the royal Kapelle at his disposal. This,
      with additions from other sources, increased his <i>personnel</i> to 200,
      and the performance was highly successful, Dittersdorf quitting Berlin
      rich in money and honours.<a href="#linknote40-42" name="linknoteref40-42"

      On May 28 Mozart set out on his homeward journey by way of Dresden and

      CHAPTER XLI. "COSÌ FAN TUTTE,"
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p237.png">[237]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      UPON his arrival in Vienna on June 4, Mozart at once set to work upon a
      quartet for Frederick William II.; the Quartet in D major (575 K.) was
      completed in the same month, and in return for it, according to the Berlin
      Veteran, he received a valuable gold snuff-box with 100 friedrichsdor, and
      a complimentary letter.<a href="#linknote41-1" name="linknoteref41-1"
      id="linknoteref41-1"> 1 </a> But this did not materially affect his
      embarrassed circumstances; the precarious state of his wife's health kept
      him in a state of perpetual anxiety, and the expenses it involved brought
      him into serious difficulties: "I am most unhappy!" he wrote on July 17 to
      his friend Puchberg. The confident expectation of a permanent improvement
      in his outward position, which he expressed in his letters to this
      constant friend, were grounded, as it seems, upon the overtures which had
      been made to him in Berlin; he had informed the Emperor of them, and
      thought himself entitled to look for a compensation for his refusal. But
      circumstances were not then favourable, and Mozart was not the man to push
      a claim of the kind. The effect of his depression is clearly visible in
      the want of musical productivity during this period. His own catalogue
      contains only the following compositions belonging to this year:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1789. June. A quartet for his majesty the King of Prussia, in D major
    </p>
    <p>
      July. Sonata for pianoforte alone, D major (576 K.). Rondo in my opera of
      "Figaro" for Madame Ferraresi del Bene, "Al desio (577 K.).

      "Alma grande e nobil core" (578 K.).

      September 17. Aria in the opera "Der Barbier von Seviglien," for Madame
      Hofer, "Schon lachtder holde Frühling" (580 K.). (575 K.).

    </p>
    <p>
      September 29. Quintet for clarinet, two violins, viola, and violoncello,
      in A major (581 K.); first played in public at the concert for the funds
      of the Pension, December 22, 1789.<a href="#linknote41-2"
      name="linknoteref41-2" id="linknoteref41-2"> 2 </a>

    <p>
      October. Aria in the opera "ü Burbero," for Mdlle. Villeneuve, "Chi sà,
      chi sà quai sia" (582 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ditto, "Vado! ma dove?" (583 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      December, An air which was intended for Benucci in the opera "Cosi fan
      Tutte," "Rivolgete à me lo sguardo" (584 K.). Twelve minuets (585 K.) and
      twelve waltzes (586 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect which was known to have been opened to him in Berlin may have
      had some effect in causing "Figaro" to be again placed on the stage in
      August. At the request of the prima donna, Madame Adriana Ferraresi del
      Bene, who had made her first appearance on October 13, 1788, Mozart wrote
      the grand air (577 K.).<a href="#linknote41-3" name="linknoteref41-3"
      id="linknoteref41-3"> 3 </a> For Louise Villeneuve he composed, during the
      following month, three airs for insertion in different operas (578, 582,
      583, K.), perhaps with some view to his own new opera, in which Mdlle.
      Villeneuve was to appear. The approbation with which the revival of
      "Figaro" was received<a href="#linknote41-4" name="linknoteref41-4"
      id="linknoteref41-4"> 4 </a> no doubt suggested to the Emperor to
      commission Mozart to write a new opera. "It was not in his power," says
      Niemetschek (p. 43), "to decline the commission, and the libretto was
      provided him without consultation of his wishes."<a href="#linknote41-5"
      name="linknoteref41-5" id="linknoteref41-5"> 5 </a> It was "Cosi fan

      engaged on it in December, 1789; and in January, 1790, it is entered in

      The plot in its main points is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two young Neapolitan<a href="#linknote41-11" name="linknoteref41-11"
      id="linknoteref41-11"> 11 </a> officers&mdash;Ferrando (tenor) and
      Guillelmo (bass)&mdash;who are betrothed to the sisters Dorabella and
      Fiordiligi, are discovered seated in a <i>café</i> in lively dispute with
      their friend Don Alfonso, an old cynic, who maintains that their two <i>fiancées</i>
      would fail under any trial of their constancy. Upon their challenge to
      make good his words at the point of the sword he retorts with the old
      proverb, that woman's faith is like the phoenix&mdash;never seen.<a
      href="#linknote41-12" name="linknoteref41-12" id="linknoteref41-12"> 12
      </a> Each of the lovers <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p240.png">[240]</a></span> declares his
      bride to be the phoenix. At last they agree to a wager. The two lovers
      promise on their word as officers to do nothing during the next
      four-and-twenty hours but what they are directed by Don Alfonso, who
      thereupon undertakes within that time to prove the fickleness of the two
      maidens. The young men, confident beforehand of victory, determine on
      celebrating it by a grand banquet in honour of their mistresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiordiligi and Dorabella are discovered in their garden by the seashore,
      awaiting the arrival of their lovers and lovingly contemplating their
      portraits; each declares her lover to be the handsomest and best. Alfonso
      entering, brings the direful news that Ferrando and Guillelmo have been
      ordered to proceed at once to the field with their regiment. The lovers
      enter with melancholy mien to bid adieu, and the two ladies give vent to
      heartrending expressions of grief and love. The lovers express
      satisfaction thereat to Don Alfonso, who bids them wait for the end. A
      military march with a lively chorus is heard in the distance;<a
      href="#linknote41-13" name="linknoteref41-13" id="linknoteref41-13"> 13
      </a> the lovers yield themselves to a last fond embrace with sobs and
      tears, at which Don Alfonso can hardly keep his countenance. The march
      again summons the officers to depart, and the two ladies join with Don
      Alfonso in waving their adieux to the retreating bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despina, the waiting-maid of the two ladies, waits for them impatiently
      with their chocolate.<a href="#linknote41-14" name="linknoteref41-14"
      id="linknoteref41-14"> 14 </a> She is amazed at their entrance in a
      condition of violent sorrow, which is expressed by Dorabella more
      especially in high tragic style. Her astonishment increases on hearing the
      cause, and she advises her mistresses to take the matter easily, and do
      all they can to divert their thoughts. The serious reproof with which this
      advice is met is answered by her in a tirade on the fickleness of men in
      general, and soldiers in particular, whom she declares to deserve no
      better treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Alfonso, in pursuance of his design, now seeks to gain over Despina. A
      few gold pieces and the prospect of a rich reward speedily gain her
      promise to admit two friends whom he declares to be madly in love with her
      mistresses. He at once introduces Ferrando and Guillelmo in the garb of
      wealthy Albanians, and so disguised by great beards as to be
      unrecognisable by Despina, who regards them as veritable "antidoto d'
      amor." While they are ingratiating themselves with the waiting-maid the
      two ladies enter. Their consternation at the presence of strangers turns
      to violent indignation when the pretended Albanians proceed without
      preface to fall on their knees and make declarations of <span class="side">LIBRETTO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p241.png">[241]</a></span> love.
      Don Alfonso, entering to prevent actual scandal, feigns to recognise old
      friends in the Albanians, and endeavours to act as mediator. The strangers
      continue their bold suit, but Fiordiligi proudly declares her faith as
      firm as a rock, and is immovable. The consequence is that upon Guillelmo
      renewing his entreaties the two ladies decline to hear him out, and make
      their exit. No sooner are they gone than the two break into loud laughter,
      which Don Alfonso with difficulty induces them to moderate. The first
      attack, which was to carry all by storm, has failed, and Don Alfonso
      retires to concoct a new plot with Despina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiordiligi and Dorabella are again discovered in the garden lamenting
      bygone happy hours, when the two Albanians rush in. They declare their
      resolution to take poison, spite of Don Alfonso's earnest dissuasions.
      Before the eyes of the cruel fair ones they swallow the contents of two
      vials, and sink in convulsions upon a bank of turf. The two horrified
      ladies call for Despina, who hurries off with Don Alfonso in search of a
      doctor, enjoining the ladies to support the sufferers during their
      absence. This, however, they dare not do, but contemplate the men from a
      distance in great agitation, which causes intense amusement to the
      disguised lovers. They gradually come nearer, and begin to express an
      interest which turns the amusement into disquiet. Don Alfonso returns with
      Despina, disguised as a doctor, a charlatan of the latest fashion, <i>à la</i>
      Mesmer, who promises to work miracles by means of magnetism. The terrified
      maidens are forced to submit to his behests, and to hold the heads of the
      sufferers, while he magnetises them back to life. Finding themselves in
      the arms of the fair ones, they begin to rave ecstatically; the ladies,
      regarding this as the commencement of the cure, allow it to continue,
      though not without uneasiness, until the patients demand a kiss from them.
      This rouses the pride of the ladies, and they break into a rage so violent
      in its demonstrations that the others begin to be doubtful of their
      sincerity; the first finale closes amid general confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the second act, Despina seeks to reason her ladies out
      of their exaggerated ideas of constancy and their dread of a
      love-adventure such as offers itself; she places before them the image of
      a maiden who treats men lightly for her amusement, and remarks with
      satisfaction that her words have made some impression. In fact, when the
      sisters are left alone, Dorabella first declares her inclination to
      hearken to Guillelmo's suit, and Fiordiligi pronounces herself ready to
      put the new ideas into practice with Ferrando. In this favourable mood Don
      Alfonso invites them to a garden-party, where the lovers receive them with
      a serenade. They now show themselves as bashful and modest as they were
      formerly urgent and bold; Don Alfonso has to speak for them, Despina
      answers for the ladies, and reconciliation is sealed by a pressure of the
      hand. After some general conversation Ferrando and Fiordiligi go off
      together. Guillelmo expresses himself <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p242.png">[242]</a></span> more
      tenderly to Dorabella, and offers her a valuable gold heart as a gift; she
      takes it without more ado, declares that she cannot offer him her heart in
      exchange, since he already possesses it, allows him to loosen Ferrando's
      portrait from her bosom, and gives way to the tenderest endearments.
      Ferrando returns with Fiordiligi, who rejects him with apparent severity,
      but lets it be felt that she is not altogether indifferent to his suit; he
      ventures upon a tender declaration of love, and, finding it still
      unheeded, goes out in despair. Left alone, she declares her heart to be
      affected, but adheres to her resolve to resist the temptation and keep
      faith with her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferrando joyfully communicates Fiordiligi's steadfastness to Guillelmo,
      but is consternated to hear from him how easily Dorabella has been won,
      and has to submit to some triumph on the part of his friend. He feels all
      the acuter pain that his love to the faithless one is not yet stifled.
      Guillelmo now regards the wager as lost, but Don Alfonso demands that one
      more attack shall be made on Fiordiligi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiordiligi reproaches her sister in unmeasured terms for her
      thoughtlessness, whereupon the latter with extreme frankness declares that
      she neither can nor will control her inclinations. Horrified at this,
      Fiordiligi determines upon escaping from her own weakness by donning man's
      attire and following her lover to the wars. She has a uniform brought in,
      puts on the helmet, takes the sword in her hand, when Ferrando rushes in
      and conjures her to slay him rather than desert him. This is too much; she
      cannot withstand his anguish, and sinks upon his breast overcome. It is
      now Guillelmo's turn to be beside himself. The two are bent upon forsaking
      their faithless mistresses, until Don Alfonso gradually succeeds in making
      them regard the affair from his own philosophical point of view: "Cosi fan
      tutte!" They decide therefore on espousing their brides, but not before
      they have punished them for their want of faith. Despina enters with the
      news that the two ladies have determined to wed their new lovers the same
      evening, and have sent her to fetch the notary. The two couples enter the
      gaily decorated room, and are received by Despina and Don Alfonso and the
      congratulatory chorus of friends and servants. Amid cheerful converse they
      place themselves at table. Despina enters as a notary, and reads the
      marriage contract. It is scarcely subscribed when the chorus and march of
      the first act are heard in the distance. Don Alfonso enters terrified with
      the news that the regiment has been suddenly recalled, and the old lovers
      are approaching the house. The Albanians and the notary are hastily
      concealed, and the ladies, in mortal fear and embarrassment, receive their
      lovers returning full of joy. Don Alfonso, acting as mediator, causes the
      notary to be discovered; but Despina declares herself, and asserts that
      she is returning from a masked ball. But the marriage contract falling
      into the hands of Guillelmo, the ladies are obliged to confess their guilt
      to their enraged lovers, whereupon the latter discover themselves as the
      Albanians, while Guillelmo returns the <span class="side">PERFORMANCES OF

      portrait to Dorabella, mockingly repeating the melody of the duet.
      Confessions ended, Don Alfonso exhorts them to make peace, and brings the
      couples together; finally, they all unite in the moral:&mdash;

      The opera was not again performed in Vienna in Italian until 1858, but it
      was produced at the Theater an der Wien in a German translation by
      Gieseke, in 1794, with the title of "Die Schule der Liebe"; in 1804 it was
      played at the Imperial Hoftheater as "Màdchentreue"; again at the Theater
      an der Wien in 1814, in Treitschke's adaptation, "Die Zauberprobe"; in
      1819 and 1840 at the Hoftheater in the earlier translation, and in 1863 in
      Schneider's adaptation. In Berlin also, where it was first given on August
      6, 1792, with the title "Eine machts wie die Andere,"<a

      The wide-spread reputation of "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni" had prepared the

      </a> with the favour which it deserved;<a href="#linknote41-33"
      name="linknoteref41-33" id="linknoteref41-33"> 33 </a> but the libretto
      was universally pronounced to be one of the worst of its kind;<a
      href="#linknote41-34" name="linknoteref41-34" id="linknoteref41-34"> 34
      </a> nor has the judgment of <span class="side">ALTERATIONS IN THE
      LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p245.png">[245]</a></span>
      posterity reversed the verdict passed upon it.<a href="#linknote41-35"
      name="linknoteref41-35" id="linknoteref41-35"> 35 </a> Two reproaches were
      more especially brought forward. One was the extreme improbability that
      neither the lovers nor Despina in their disguises would have been
      recognised by the two ladies, and the other the outrage committed on the
      moral sense by the frivolity of the test imposed, and if possible still
      more by the ease with which, after the unfortunate issue of the trial, the
      lovers all adopt a philosophic toleration towards each other. These two
      blemishes, however, will scarcely account for the fact that, even where
      attempts have been made to remove them by adaptation, the opera has never
      maintained its place on the stage.<a href="#linknote41-36"
      name="linknoteref41-36" id="linknoteref41-36"> 36 </a> Unquestionably, the
      device of the disguise is trivial, and in itself not at all entertaining,
      but the number of popular comedies the main point of which consists in
      disguise prove that the public in this respect is not hard to please. It
      makes no undue call on the imagination of the spectators to proceed on
      this supposition, although in every drama deviations more or less
      important must thereby be made from reality. But the imagination refuses
      to accept these improbabilities unless they are made to serve as external
      manifestations of events and actions which seem thus to be taking their
      regular course. If they are made the foundation for events which are
      manifestly false to nature, the revulsion in the spectator's mind is
      extended to the improbable representation itself. Treitschke hit upon the
      most unfortunate device for obviating the difficulty, by turning Alfonso
      into a magician and Despina into a sprite, and thereby not only producing
      glaring inconsistencies, but completely nullifying the musical
      characterisation. Another attempt was made by Krebel in an adaptation
      called "Màdchen sind Màdchen," performed in Stuttgart in 1816, where the
      lovers return home after a lengthened absence and <span class="side">COSÏ
      FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p246.png">[246]</a></span>
      before appearing to their brides undertake and carry out the trial of
      their constancy; Despina undertakes the cure in her own person, and in the
      last finale a real notary is brought on, whom she afterwards declares to
      be her lover. The progress of the plot is completely changed, almost all
      the songs are transformed and taken from their proper connection.
      Herklot's alterations in "Die verhangnissvolle Wette" went still deeper.<a
      href="#linknote41-37" name="linknoteref41-37" id="linknoteref41-37"> 37
      </a> The ladies are not put to the test by their own lovers, but, with the
      connivance of the latter, by two of their friends, whose servant Pedrillo
      takes part in the intrigue as the doctor and the notary. Not to mention
      the injury which the musical characterisation suffers thereby, the
      clumsiness of the test imposed is made still more apparent, and the final
      reconciliation becomes more unreal and revolting.

      Da Ponte has made no effort to soften the awkwardness of the situation; it
      is indeed very much increased by the exchange of lovers made during the
      trial, as if the right choice was that which is then made. G. Bernhard
      (Gugler), who has done honour both to words and music by his excellent
      edition of the opera,<a href="#linknote41-38" name="linknoteref41-38"
      id="linknoteref41-38"> 38 </a> removed this obstacle in his adaptation,
      "Sind sie treu?" (Stuttgart, 1858). Here each lover proves his own
      mistress, and the plot and its development are modified accordingly.<a
      href="#linknote41-39" name="linknoteref41-39" id="linknoteref41-39"> 39
      </a> Da Ponte sacrificed the excuse this would have afforded to the two
      ladies&mdash;who might be supposed unconsciously drawn towards the true
      object of their affections&mdash;to the dramatic effect of the
      embarrassing position of the men on either side. Attempts to remedy this
      defect led to other and greater ones.<a href="#linknote41-40"
      name="linknoteref41-40" id="linknoteref41-40"> 40 </a> In an old
      adaptation, "Die Wette, oder Màdchen-List und -Liebe," the author <span

      href="pgimages/p247.png">[247]</a></span> (whose name is unknown to me)
      has hit upon the device of making the waiting-maid betray Don Alfonso's
      plot to the sisters before the entrance of the pretended friends, so that
      they are supposed to be hoaxing their lovers all the time, and the latter
      have to sue for pardon at the end. Despina's disguise as the doctor is
      retained, but a real notary is brought in for the last finale. Arnold
      proceeded similarly in his English version, "Tit for Tat."<a
      href="#linknote41-41" name="linknoteref41-41" id="linknoteref41-41"> 41
      </a> L. Schneider, too, has made the same alteration, with the difference
      that Despina does not betray to her mistresses the plot against them until
      the second act, from which time they feign the weakness with which they
      mean to chastise their lovers. But this alteration implies a coarseness of
      conduct in the two sisters which is scarcely less reprehensible than their
      fickleness. The musical characterisation also is destroyed, since they are
      now supposed to feign the sentiments which they were originally intended
      to express in all seriousness; the inconsistency is sometimes unendurable.
      Added to this, the second finale is nullified by the altered catastrophe,
      and the charming part omitted where the men recall the characters assumed
      by them.<a href="#linknote41-42" name="linknoteref41-42"

      It would have been necessary to bring the psychological interest of the
      drama into the foreground in order to conceal what was objectionable in
      the situations. Ingenuity and delicacy of invention might have turned the
      subject into an interesting drama, with the guilt and mishaps so evenly
      balanced that the whole might naturally come to a cheerful and pacifying
      conclusion. Da Ponte's text in no way fulfils these requirements; he takes
      his stand on the level of the ordinary opera buffa, and demands to be
      measured by that standard. He makes some attempt at more delicate
      characterisation in his Fiordiligi, in which Ferrando partakes, but the
      remaining characters are all of the usual opera buffa type, and only
      receive their individual stamp by virtue of the music. Nor do the
      situations <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p248.png">[248]</a></span> display much more of original
      invention. The only animation afforded to the play, consisting of the
      pretended poisoning and the entrance of Despina as doctor, is neither new
      nor refined, and the plot proceeds without exciting either interest or
      suspense. But it gives occasion for a succession of musical situations
      which, considered apart, have been skilfully treated by Da Ponte. The
      parting scene, the sestet, and especially the first finale, are thoroughly
      musical in design, and Da Ponte's verses are easy and flowing, often not
      devoid of wit. Unfortunately his energies are almost all exhausted in the
      first act. While this contains a wealth of ensemble movements and
      contrasting situations scarcely to be found in any other opera, the
      monotony of the second act is strikingly apparent. It does not seem to
      have occurred to Da Ponte to develop his plot by means of an artistic
      arrangement of ensemble pieces. His sole care has evidently been to
      apportion the airs and duets indispensable to the chief characters in
      opera buffa with a due regard to dramatic contrast.<a href="#linknote41-43"

      Mozart therefore found himself once more engaged upon an opera buffa in
      the strict sense of the term. The plot is without meaning, the characters
      without individuality, deriving what effect they have by means of the
      ordinary resources of low comedy and exaggeration. Passion and feeling
      rarely assert themselves without the disturbing elements of hypocrisy and
      deceit; and thus the source of Mozart's own peculiar conception of musical
      representation is virtually closed to him. Then, in addition, the demands
      of the artists had to be taken into consideration. We can only wonder,
      under the circumstances, at Mozart's power of seizing every point which
      could be turned to the service of his artistic conceptions; the work
      reveals a side of his nature which has not hitherto appeared.<a

      The unreserved expression of emotions throughout the <span class="side">THE
      MUSIC&mdash;ENSEMBLES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p249.png">[249]</a></span> opera affords a not ungrateful
      field for musical representation. The awkwardness of having three terzets
      for male voices following each other disappears under Mozart's treatment,
      since he makes each the natural outcome of the situation, and they serve
      as joint members of one organism to produce a natural climax. The first
      terzet takes its tone from the excited mood of the young officers, which
      Don Alfonso seeks with easy playfulness to moderate. In the second, Don
      Alfonso comes to the foreground with his old song about the phoenix and
      woman's faith, which he sings in a tone of good-humoured irony,
      exceedingly well supported by the orchestra, while the other two try
      mainly to interpose and stop him; it is a most original piece of music,
      full of excellent humour. The third terzet displays the high spirits of
      the lovers, raised to a pitch of great excitement, and the music brings
      the merry feast to which they are already looking forward vividly before
      the mind. The light and cheerful, somewhat superficial tone which here
      prevails, fixes the ground-tone of the opera. The young men are
      characterised generally, without accentuating their individualities; they
      stand opposed to Don Alfonso, whose contrasting character comes out all
      the more sharply. The duet for the two sisters (4) is more elevated in
      tone, to accord with the situation. They are melting in tender emotion as
      they gaze on the images of their lovers, and the expression of the music
      is full of life and sensuality, but more animated than warm, with no echo
      of those gentle accents in which Mozart elsewhere so inimitably
      characterises the hidden longings of the soul. The unanimity of sentiment
      here again obscures individual character, and the modifications are more
      musical than dramatic in their nature. Don Alfonso's <span class="side">COSI
      FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p250.png">[250]</a></span>
      short air (5), where he appears to urge composure, characterises not his
      true nature, for he is feigning all the time, but the situation, and that
      with a degree of exaggeration which comes out in striking relief to his
      otherwise calm and equable nature. The tone and delivery of the air are
      correctly indicated by Don Alfonso's words: "non son cattivo comico"; the
      deceit is conscious and evident throughout, and it is rendered easy for
      the performer to let an ironical tone occasionally peep through. The
      following quintet (6) carries us to a height hitherto unsuspected. The
      grief of the sisters at the prospect of separation from their lovers is
      expressed with ever-increasing passion, while conscious dissimulation
      imposes a certain restraint on the men, though the emotion they express is
      in itself genuine enough; the softer nature of Ferrando betrays itself in
      his gradually increasing sympathy with the sorrowing women. The ironical
      element introduced by Don Alfonso, just at the point when the passionate
      lamentation of the sisters is making the greatest impression on their
      lovers, prevents the situation from passing altogether into the pathetic
      vein. This quintet undoubtedly belongs in every respect to Mozart's
      highest achievements. The short duet (7) on the other hand, in which
      Ferrando and Guillelmo seek to console their trembling fair, ones is poor
      both in musical substance and characterisation, being an easily
      constructed piece of the kind which the general public loved. The march
      with chorus (8), which comes next, is simple, but very fresh and pretty,
      well suited both to the situation and the character of the opera. The
      farewell scene (9) takes place at the same time&mdash;indicated in the
      autograph score as "Recitativo coi stromenti"&mdash;and is a perfect
      masterpiece of beauty and delicate characterisation. The broken sobs of
      the afflicted women have something of the same comic effect as the
      infinite sorrow of childhood, and the men seem, half involuntarily, to
      imitate them; but when the last adieux have been exchanged they give vent
      to such a sweet and touching sound of lamentation that even the lovers are
      touched by it, and Don Alfonso is silenced. The repetition of the chörus
      interrupts the tender leave-taking just at the right time, and endows the
      scene with fresh life and animation. It finds an appropriate conclusion in
      the <span class="side">TERZET.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p251.png">[251]</a></span> tones and gestures of the two
      maidens as they wave their adieux from the shore, while Don Alfonso
      appears to share their feelings with a sort of ostentation of sympathy.
      This terzettino (10) shows Mozart's power of displaying endless shades of
      one and the same feeling. The farewells wafted from the shore are more
      composed than the lamentations called forth by the idea of separation, or
      even by the separation itself; they are more pure also, more intense, and
      transfigure all that has gone before with the light of a tender and
      harmonious grace finding its expression in separate sharp suspensions, and
      especially in the unexpected dissonance which occurs upon "desir&mdash;[See

      The murmuring accompaniment of the muted violins, combined with the soft
      full chords of the wind instruments, suggesting the idea of the
      sea-voyage, contribute to the colouring of this gem of musical expression.
      The instrumentation throughout this first division of the opera is
      carefully and admirably managed. The first terzet is simple, the lively
      figures for the stringed instruments denoting its character, while the
      oboes, bassoons, and horns strengthen the lights and shades; it is quite
      otherwise in the second, where the stringed instruments have a gentle
      accompanying passage, while a flute and a bassoon carry on the melody of
      the song; the third is brilliant with trumpets and drums, shrill oboes and
      rapid violin passages. During the whole of the love scene the clarinets
      are kept in the foreground, the combined orchestra is full and soft, but
      milder and more sparkling in the last terzet, where flutes come in; the
      contrasting clang of the lively and vigorous march is highly effective.
      Thus far all has taken a natural course, and we <span class="side">COSÌ
      FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p252.png">[252]</a></span>
      have met with no unusual characters, no startling situations; the emotions
      represented have been true and simple, and have been the necessary
      consequences of the events composing the easily comprehended plot. The
      musical depicting of such emotions is a grateful task; if it is true in
      itself and a faithful rendering of the given situation it cannot fail of
      its effect. And Mozart has here combined truth of characterisation with a
      beauty of form and a charm of sweet sound which almost overpower the ear,
      and are scarcely to be found in such fulness in any other of his operas.
      The further development of the plot leads to a sharper characterisation of
      individuals. Dorabella first unfolds her grief in a grand air (n)
      introduced by an accompanied recitative. It consists of one movement
      (allegro agitato) which receives its distinctive character from the
      sextole passage for the violins&mdash;[See Page Image] which does not
      cease for one bar until just before the end; an unsteady trembling
      movement is imparted to it by varied harmonic transitions, and an
      occasional sharper accentuation by the full chords of the wind
      instruments. The simple sustained voice-part moves above this
      accompaniment in short expressive phrases, rising now and then to a tone
      of passionate appeal, and at the close to an unexpected pathos. Both in
      musical treatment and emotional expression the air takes a high rank; but
      none the less is it in striking contradiction to the character of
      Dorabella as it is afterwards developed. It is she who proposes to her
      sister to coquet with the new lovers, and in the duet (20) in which they
      agree to do so it is she who takes the initiative. In the duet with
      Guillelmo (23)<a href="#linknote41-45" name="linknoteref41-45"
      id="linknoteref41-45"> 45 </a> she shows herself so easily persuaded and
      so full of amorous passion that it appears the revelation of her true
      nature. It renders superfluous her subsequent expression of opinion in an
      air (28) that love rules over all hearts, and it is but folly to resist
      his sway. This air has a certain resemblance to the first in the
      simplicity of the <span class="side">DORABELLA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p253.png">[253]</a></span> voice-part
      and the moderation of the expression, although the feelings inspiring it
      are of such a different nature. The accompaniment again bestows upon the
      song its peculiar colouring; and the great prominence given to the wind
      instruments adds an insinuating and specious tone to the whole. But a
      closer examination reveals the evident contrast of the two songs.
      Dorabella is a woman of lively but not deep feeling; excitement is
      necessary to her, even though it may be of a painful nature&mdash;she
      cannot live without it. Her expressions of sorrow increase in intensity,
      and the orchestra is markedly toned down to allow her to display her true,
      somewhat shallow nature. Besides this, the exaggerated tone of her grief,
      displaying its want of perfect sincerity, is strongly marked by the words,
      e.g.&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Esempio misero d' amor funesto
     Darö all' Eumenidi, se viva resto,
     Col suono orribile de' miei sospir&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      and the music takes the cue therefrom. While borrowing the pathetic tone
      and form of the opera seria, she turns them into a parody like that of the
      text, invoking the furies with all the rhetorical apparatus of tragedy;
      this is especially noticeable towards the close:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p254.png">[254]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The parody facilitates the difficult task of carrying the musical
      expression of emotion to an exaggerated degree without making it ugly and
      unnatural. The refined delivery of the vocalist, and the ready
      apprehension of the audience, must always be presupposed. In the character
      of Fiordiligi Da Ponte has unquestionably kept Ferraresi del Bene in view;
      he was said to stand in tender relations towards her.<a
      href="#linknote41-46" name="linknoteref41-46" id="linknoteref41-46"> 46
      </a> According to him she had a fine voice and an original and affecting
      delivery, and this opinion was confirmed by the London critics, although
      she was never considered there as a true prima donna;<a
      href="#linknote41-47" name="linknoteref41-47" id="linknoteref41-47"> 47
      </a> and Mozart himself remarked that it was not saying much to pronounce
      Allegrandi far superior to Ferraresi. She had not a good figure, and was
      but an indifferent actress; but she had beautiful eyes and a charming
      mouth, and was in great favour with the public. It is not surprising,
      therefore, that Fiordiligi should have been placed on a higher level than
      her sister, both musically and dramatically.<a href="#linknote41-48"
      name="linknoteref41-48" id="linknoteref41-48"> 48 </a> Her very first air
      (14) places her in a far more favourable light. The disguised lovers,
      after a decided repulse, renew their shameless attack. Fiordiligi's
      condescending to answer them and to assert her inflexible constancy may
      not, indeed, be a proof of fine feeling on her part, but it demands an
      energetic and emphatic tone and strong and appropriate colouring. We
      therefore have a bravura air in two movements, an andante and allegro,
      closed by a long coda in accelerated tempo. The comic effect again rests
      on the element of parody, which is even more strongly marked than in
      Dorabella's air; the bravura passages, intervals of octaves, tenths and
      twelfths, the roulades which she flings at her opponents, the bass-like
      passages in the deeper register of the voice, all characterise
      Fiordiligi's Amazon-like haughtiness in an exaggerated manner. Afterwards,
      it is true, she <span class="side">FERRANDO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p255.png">[255]</a></span> is induced by her more
      thoughtless sister to coquet with the new lover, but Dorabella's lover
      presents himself after a fashion calculated to make a strong impression
      upon her. Guillelmo is always light-hearted and cheerful; while, even in
      the parting scene, Ferrando has shown himself to be a man of softer mould.
      His air (17), after the first repulse of his suit, leaves no doubt as to
      his nature. It renders the vapid sentimentality of the words with
      remarkable tenderness and delicacy, but this kind of sentimentality being
      quite foreign to the southern nature, the portrayal of it would rouse more
      ridicule than sympathy. Such a character cuts a comic figure upon the
      'stage&mdash;a circumstance which must be borne in mind in considering
      this opera. Even in his feigned wooing he expresses his feelings with
      warmth and animation, his eccentricities being indeed heightened by the
      difficulties of the situation. This is just the demeanour calculated to
      make an impression on Fiordiligi, and she soon begins to waver. Perceiving
      this, he expresses his delight with an extravagance which a man of calmer
      temperament would have been incapable of dissembling;<a
      href="#linknote41-49" name="linknoteref41-49" id="linknoteref41-49"> 49
      </a> it is evident that his fancy gets the better of his excited feelings.
      So apprehended, this air (24) not only entrances our minds by its
      continuous flow of lovely melody, but gives us a sense of natural fitness
      for the situation and characters. It would have been an impossible task
      for music to represent Ferrando as singing this song with coolly
      calculated dissimulation; for the exaggeration of caricature is only
      appropriate when no conviction is required to be brought home to us,
      whereas here the impression experienced by Fiordiligi must be shared by
      the audience before it can become intelligible. The music must therefore
      express a feeling by which a man of excitable nature would be likely to be
      carried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way only can we justify the deep impression made upon the equally
      excitable Fiordiligi, when, left alone, she reproaches herself doubly for
      having coquetted with Ferrando, and been false at heart to her lover. The
      feeling <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p256.png">[256]</a></span> of remorse, and of newly
      strengthened fidelity which the memory of her absent lover inspires, is
      charmingly expressed in the lovely air (25), "Per pietà, ben mio,
      perdona." This is genuine emotion, springing from the heart, and the music
      expresses it with all the charm of pure melody. This important air, in two
      elaborate movements&mdash;adagio and allegro&mdash;gives ample opportunity
      for display to the singer and an independent part to the wind instruments,
      especially the horns, without doing injury to truth of expression. It is
      undeniably akin to the great air in "Figaro" (p. 92) composed for the same
      Ferraresi, although they differ both in tone and colouring. Probably the
      individuality of the singer, distinctly recognisable in the three songs,
      exerted considerable influence over their composition; and it may also be
      remarked that too vivid a representation of such a mood as this would have
      exceeded the limits of opera buffa; even as it is it suggests almost too
      serious a complication and solution of the situation. Ferrando, on
      learning the faithlessness of his Dorabella, breaks at first into violent
      indignation; but this soon gives way to softer feelings, which he cannot
      overcome. In his lovely cavatina (27)&mdash;so Mozart has entitled it&mdash;his
      anger is only faintly suggested, while the memory of his still-loved
      Dorabella shines forth from the darkness of the soul.<a
      href="#linknote41-50" name="linknoteref41-50" id="linknoteref41-50"> 50
      </a> While he is yet in this sentimental mood he is urged by Don Alfonso
      to make one more attack upon Fiordiligi's heart. With this intent, he
      surprises her in the act of putting into effect her romantic determination
      to escape from her own weakness by donning man's attire and following her
      lover to the wars. The duet which ensues (29) is of singular design and
      unusually rich elaboration. In contrast with Fiordiligi's grandiloquent
      sentiments, as she fancies herself again by the side of her lover, comes
      the melancholy plaint, the urgent petition of Ferrando; her resistance
      grows weaker as his entreaties grow more earnest&mdash;until at last she
      sinks into <span class="side">FERRANDO&mdash;GUILLELMO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p257.png">[257]</a></span> his arms.
      This scene consists of a regularly worked-out duet in two movements, but
      the long suspense requires a corresponding length of reaction from it, and
      we have to all intents and purposes a second duet, with two movements
      expressive of the happiness of the lovers. Here again the expression of
      feeling is so direct and true that we cannot but imagine Ferrando carried
      away by the impulse of the moment. In fact, these two characters and their
      relations to each other are somewhat out of keeping with the rest of the
      opera. Da Ponte failed in giving due effect to the deeper psychological
      interest of the characters; Mozart has clothed them in flesh and blood,
      but even he has failed to endow them with the distinct and vivid
      personality which is to be found in "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni."

      No doubt the idiosyncrasies of the performers, who were for the most part
      more of singers than actors, and had apparently not much talent for
      comedy, had considerable influence on the plan of the piece;<a

      in his disguise as an Albanian, his first attack has been repulsed and,
      Fiordiligi having expressed her haughty indignation, he boldly ventures on
      a fresh declaration of love. Here he had originally an air (584 K.) of the
      most decided buffo type, which opposed to the exaggerated pathos of
      Fiordiligi an extravagance of a different kind, and expressed in strong
      caricature the confidence of the new wooers in the ultimate success of

      Mozart has turned this into a comic air in the grand style, worthy to rank
      with those of Leporello, although the delicate malice which characterises
      the latter would be out of place here. The various points, not only where
      the mention of dancing and singing suggest musical freaks, but throughout,
      are made effective in the happiest musical contrasts, without disturbing
      the flow and consistency of the whole song. Towards the close especially,
      the climax is inimitable. After the transition into D minor on "trillo"
      and "uscignolo"&mdash;[See Page Image] <span class="side">GUILLELMO'S AIR.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p259.png">[259]</a></span> the
      wind instruments sound a mocking fanfare to the violin quavers on "qualch'
      altro capitale"&mdash;[See Page Image] <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p260.png">[260]</a></span>
      whereupon Guillelmo, after the exit of the sisters, breaks out with the
      whole strength of his voice into a triumphant allegro molto&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      but stops suddenly, as if afraid of being overheard, and sings his joy
      sotto voce to Don Alfonso. This air, which afforded abundant opportunity
      for the display of voice and art to the happiest advantage, was laid on
      one side, no doubt with the conviction that so evident a caricature could
      not be maintained throughout the love-test without wedding internal to
      external improbabilities, and displaying Guillelmo in two distinct
      characters. Another air (15) was therefore substituted, expressing
      Guillelmo's character as a cheerful man of the world who takes serious
      matters lightly, and comports himself with ease and freedom. He turns half
      confidently, half jokingly to the ladies, the secret pleasure which their
      rejection of his suit affords him increasing his cheerfulness, and even
      giving it a tinge of irony. The music is quite simple, tuneful, light and
      pleasing, in direct contrast to the previous grand air. His second air
      (26) in which, after his adventure with Dorabella, his good opinion of
      women is considerably modified, is in perfect harmony with the first. The
      feeling that he has the advantage over Ferrando, the <span class="side">GUILLELMO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p261.png">[261]</a></span>
      assurance of Fiordiligi's unalterable faith, give him an air of
      overweening security, and cause him to express himself with a lightness
      which he would certainly have refrained from had he known how nearly the
      matter affected himself. This is a truly comic situation, and Mozart has
      given effect to it mainly by the tone of easy merriment which he has
      caught so admirably, and which never passes the bounds of friendly
      good-humour. The air is long, singer and orchestra vying with each other
      in rapid animation, and the jovial, easy character of the man is fully and
      pleasantly expressed.<a href="#linknote41-53" name="linknoteref41-53"
      id="linknoteref41-53"> 53 </a> His intercourse with Dorabella corresponds
      with this view. The easy, half-jesting gallantry with which he approaches
      her in the duet (23) belongs to his nature, and the part he is playing is
      no effort to him. It is more than once made plain that Dorabella is more
      strongly affected than he; after she has once met his advances with favour
      he merely seconds her, as being pledged to do so; but he does it with the
      same ease and confidence that he has displayed throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart has shown correct judgment in making Guillelmo' a natural,
      good-humoured character, instead of a caricatured buffo figure. But a
      motive seems to have been at work here which appears throughout the whole
      of "Cosi fan Tutte." It is evident that Mozart has sought to clear himself
      from the reproach that his music was too heavy, too serious for a comic
      opera, and to satisfy the taste of the public for what was light and
      entertaining. This demand was met in the two male duets, the first (7)
      being light and superficial, and the second a serenade (21), which
      (accompanied, according to custom, only by wind instruments) follows a
      striking chorus with a melodious and pleasing effect, but without
      individual character. The same motive is even more evidently at work in
      the character of Despina. She never betrays a particle of true feeling.
      She has no sympathy <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p262.png">[262]</a></span> either for
      her mistresses, or for their lovers, or for Don Alfonso, and she has no
      love affair of her own. The only visible motive of action with her is
      selfishness, which triumphs even over her love of intrigue; every
      expression of hers shows giddy thoughtlessness, not always of the most
      refined kind. Her two songs are both addressed to her ladies. The first
      (12) is in answer to Dorabella's pathetic burst of sorrow, and scoffs at
      her belief in the constancy of men, while urging her to reward inconstancy
      with inconstancy. The second (19) exhorts the still undecided fair ones to
      adopt coquetry as the true rule of life for the female sex. In the first
      air the gaiety, lightly tinged with humour in the short introductory
      allegretto, is light and easy, and has a forwardness about it not quite
      maidenly, but so pretty and winning that the whole person is invested with
      a certain interest and attractiveness. In the second air Despina appears
      as the temptress; therefore the action is more careful, the expression
      more delicate; insinuating persuasion takes the place of her former
      pertness, and the comic element only asserts itself once in the strongly
      accented:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    E qual regina
    Dali' alto soglio
    Coll posso e voglio
    Farsi ubbidir.
</pre>
    <p>
      This air reminds us in many points of Zerlina, but it serves also to prove
      how many touches of detail and delicate shades of musical expression are
      wanting when true feeling is not at the root of the conception. Spite of
      its commonplace tone, its lively gaiety gives it a certain charm, just as
      in everyday life we often meet with people commonplace in their nature,
      but attractive from their youthful freshness and cheerfulness. But Despina
      is in her element when she herself is playing some extravagant prank, and
      she adopts her various disguises with much boldness and gay humour. The
      scene where she enters as a doctor in the first finale belongs
      indisputably to the wittiest performances of comic music. After the long
      suspense, the animation caused by the entrance of the doctor has an
      excellent effect, and the <span class="side">DESPINA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p263.png">[263]</a></span> boastful
      loquacity and solemn conceit of the charlatan stand out from the
      surroundings without the need of any special medium for their expression.
      Every phrase is pronounced simply but with telling effect; exaggeration,
      which at this point of the situation would only do harm, is carefully
      avoided, and the general impression of unclouded gaiety is heightened by
      the intensity with which the other characters express their feelings.<a
      href="#linknote41-54" name="linknoteref41-54" id="linknoteref41-54"> 54
      </a> The notary in the second finale is quite as humorously depicted.
      After an elaborate greeting, the polite elegance of which is mockingly
      expressed by the figure in the accompaniment, given to the second violins,
      the notary begins to read the marriage contract in a monotone (<i>pel naso</i>,
      Mozart directs), which is the most comic imitation of reality in its five
      times repeated phrase&mdash;[See Page Image] twice with additional
      emphasis:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The accompaniment of the violins is different for each clause (the basses
      remaining the same), and increases in speed, thus producing a climax
      provoked by the impatient exclamations of the bridal party. The whole
      conception of the part of Despina may be referred to the individuality of
      its first performer, Signora Bussani, whose reputation was <span
      class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p264.png">[264]</a></span> rather for spirit and audacity
      than for delicacy of expression (Vol. III., p. 97). Another example of
      perfect gaiety is the terzet for the three male voices (16). After the
      angry exit of the sisters, Guillelmo and Ferrando begin to laugh,<a
      href="#linknote41-55" name="linknoteref41-55" id="linknoteref41-55"> 55
      </a> thereby increasing the discomfiture of Don Alfonso, who with
      difficulty persuades them to desist. The merriment of the young men, the
      annoyance of the old one, the laughter which they vainly endeavour to
      suppress, are so admirably expressed, and the triplet passage of the
      accompaniment adds so strikingly to the effect, that we feel the same
      irresistible inclination to merriment that is inspired by the countenance
      of an antique laughing satyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      The counterpart to Despina is Don Alfonso,<a href="#linknote41-56"
      name="linknoteref41-56" id="linknoteref41-56"> 56 </a> who displays
      throughout the plot no single impulse of sympathy or good-nature, and at
      the same time fails to inspire interest as a purely comic character.
      Paltry scepticism without humour or good-temper, cold rationalism without
      any tinge of geniality, are not attractive in themselves, and are
      essentially unmusical; they can only be effective by virtue of contrast,
      and Don Alfonso therefore appears principally in ensembles. In the first
      male terzet his cool demeanour stands in excellent relief against the
      excitement of the young men, and Mozart has given an irresistibly droll
      expression to the little ballad which he mockingly sings to them (2). His
      sympathy in the parting scene has more delicacy of characterisation; here
      he keeps in the background, but the quiet remarks which he interposes add
      just the ingredient to the melting sentiment of the ladies which is
      required for the production of the right effect on the audience. As a
      rule, however, Don Alfonso does not express his true sentiments, and his
      dissimulation induces an exaggeration which is not without comic effect,
      but requires great refinement of delivery. It belongs to the conception of
      such a character that he should abstain from asserting himself
      independently, and therefore <span class="side">DON ALFONSO.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p265.png">[265]</a></span> no grand air
      is assigned to him; this may be partly owing, however, to the deficiencies
      of the first performer, for Bus-sani does not appear to have been much of
      a singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His two most important solo pieces are purposely so arranged as to admit
      of an amount of sentiment which is foreign to his true character. In the
      first he expresses with evident exaggeration the consternation which fills
      him at the afflicting intelligence which he is bringing to the sisters; it
      is as characteristic of the person as of the situation, and expresses at
      once the state of excitement which prevails throughout the following
      scene. Of more original design is the short ensemble movement (22) in
      which Don Alfonso and Despina bring the two couples together.<a
      href="#linknote41-57" name="linknoteref41-57" id="linknoteref41-57"> 57
      </a> By undertaking to be the mouthpiece of the bashful lovers, Don
      Alfonso gains an opportunity of expressing himself with more feeling, and
      yet his position does not admit of any very deep or serious expression on
      his part. The device of making the two lovers strike in like an echo is a
      happy one; but Da Ponte has not turned it to the advantage of which it was
      capable. It is quite right that Fiordiligi and Dorabella should not join
      in in the same way when Despina answers for them; but to leave them quite
      out of the question, and to make the interest of the situation centre in
      the by-play of Don Alfonso and Despina, destroys the significance which
      this scene might have had. A teasing, jesting tone predominates throughout
      the movement, and is indeed in keeping with the whole opera; but we long
      for a little more energy and fulness of expression at the more important
      points. In order to place Don Alfonso in the right light, he should be
      shown in real perplexity, and brought thereby into the <span class="side">COSÌ
      FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p266.png">[266]</a></span>
      foreground. The laughing terzet passes too quickly to make this motive
      effective. Besides the terzet, he has only two short movements wherein to
      express his views on the inconstancy of women, and these in a sort of
      accompanied recitative suggest very vividly his exalted and pedantic turn
      of mind. In the latter of the two he proceeds through a very simple but
      suggestive climax to point his closing moral&mdash;[See Page Image] and
      the converted but appeased lovers join in at his desire:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      As has already been remarked, Mozart took this phrase as the motto for his
      overture. It is introduced by a short andante, which, after two quick
      chords, begins with a tender motif for the oboe; this is interrupted by
      repeated chords, but starts again, whereupon first the bass, and then the
      full orchestra, give out the "Cosi fan tutte" as above,<a
      href="#linknote41-58" name="linknoteref41-58" id="linknoteref41-58"> 58
      </a> and immediately lead into the presto which is to demonstrate the
      significance of the phrase. A short cursory phrase&mdash;rises in rapid
      crescendo for the violins through two octaves; and then all the parts, in
      syncopated rhythm&mdash;[See Page Image] <span class="side">THE OVERTURE&mdash;ENSEMBLES.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p267.png">[267]</a></span> seem to
      stop the way for some moments, only to give place to a light running
      passage&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      which the wind instruments take up by turns. These are the elements which
      in rapid and incessant alternation chase each other through the overture
      like feather balls tossed from hand to hand, until the merry game is
      interrupted by the phrase which gave birth to it: "Cosi fan tutte!" Again
      the crescendo rises to its highest pitch, and closes with a few powerful
      chords. The gay and wanton tone of the opera could scarcely be better
      suggested, the overture being in very truth the most perfect expression of
      careless gaiety. In the clear flow of its lively frolic we see some
      resemblance to the overture to "Figaro," but the deep, fine feeling which
      shines through the tumult of the earlier work would be out of place, and
      may be sought for in vain in the overture before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters presented to us in this opera lend themselves best to
      musical treatment when they join in ensemble pieces.<a
      href="#linknote41-59" name="linknoteref41-59" id="linknoteref41-59"> 59
      </a> The definite situations give strength to the characterisation, which
      is further aided by the contrast of the persons concerned; and the
      dramatic motive adds variety and energy of expression. The sestet in the
      first act (13) is very simple in design, but effective from its
      well-placed contrasts and judicious climax. The introduction of the
      friends has a marchlike character. Don Alfonso recommends them to
      Despina's favour, and they add more lively entreaties, in accordance with
      their assumed characters; Despina's mirth <span class="side">COSÌ FAN
      TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p268.png">[268]</a></span>
      is excited by the extraordinary figures before her, while they are
      delighted to find that she does not recognise them.
    </p>

      The action begins with the entrance of the two ladies. The urgent suit of
      the lovers is now opposed to the strong displeasure of the sisters,
      Despina making common cause with the former. The declaration of love is
      emphasised in an unusual fashion by the transition of the harmony into a
      minor key,<a href="#linknote41-60" name="linknoteref41-60"
      id="linknoteref41-60"> 60 </a> by the chromatic movement of the parts, and
      by the clarinet, bassoon, and violoncello accompaniment. The astonishment
      of the two ladies at first gives a painful tone to the expression, but as
      soon as they have recovered sufficiently to give vent to their indignation
      the situation changes. The lovers rejoice in silence over this proof of
      fidelity, while Despina and Don Alfonso affect to find some grounds for
      suspicion in the very violence of the resentment displayed by the sisters.
      The grouping of the characters is also changed. Fiordiligi and Dorabella,
      divided between anger at the intruders and the remembrance of their absent
      lovers, stand together; on the other side the lovers join issue, and
      Despina and Don Alfonso observe the course of affairs together; it is with
      right judgment that the two latter are put prominently forward, especially
      at the passage&mdash;[See Page Image] for they command the situation, and
      this passage throws a light upon the tumult and confusion which prevail.
      Mozart's temperate discrimination in the use of means has here again
      enabled him to mould all this into a musical whole of perfect unity. The
      situation of the first finale is nearly allied to this, but more vividly
      characterised in the details, and more elaborately worked out. It begins
      with a very amorous <span class="side">THE FIRST FINALE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p269.png">[269]</a></span> duet for the
      forsaken fair ones, introduced by a long ritornello and worked out in
      independent style; a counterpart to the first duet, only that here the
      expression is naturally more fond and languishing. The sensual, dreamy
      mood thus represented is broken in upon by the harsh dissonances and
      disjointed rhythm of the poisoning scene, and ends with a pathetic
      ensemble and the swooning of the lovers. During the absence of Don Alfonso
      and Despina in quest of aid, a calmer tone is adopted, which grows
      gradually more animated as the sisters express their terror and anxiety,
      and the lovers their satisfaction at the state of affairs, and enjoyment
      of the comic scene in which they are playing the chief parts. But when the
      sympathy displayed by the ladies at the sight of their apparent sufferings
      gradually becomes so demonstrative that there seems some danger of pity
      being transformed to love, the tables are turned, the lovers begin to be
      anxious, and a state of painful suspense overmasters them all. At this
      point there occurs one of those deeper and more delicate psychological
      manifestations which Mozart so well knew how to render, and in which, as
      usual, the orchestra co-operates. At first, two characteristic motifs
      which go through the whole movement, a triplet figure&mdash;[See Page
      Image] and an interrupted one of quite a different character&mdash;
      combine together, but then there enter two others&mdash; to express the
      painful sensations of the poisoned lovers. The orchestra carries this idea
      out in manifold combinations, and thus affords a characteristic groundwork
      for the expressions of gradually augmenting compassion. The lovers, become
      suspicious, now express their anxiety, and they finally all concur in a
      distrustful uncertainty, plaintively <span class="side">COSÌ FAN TUTTE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p270.png">[270]</a></span>
      rendered by imitative chromatic passages. The entertaining and truly comic
      element of the situation consists in the fact that the merry trick which
      Ferrando and Guillelmo hoped to play takes so doubtful a turn, and that
      the emotions, on both sides genuine, spring from quite other sources, and
      take quite different directions from those which are outwardly indicated.
      Mozart has seized the situation with ready humour, and, as usual, the
      right apprehension of the dramatic part of the work has improved the
      conception and treatment of the musical element; this movement is in every
      respect a masterpiece, and belongs to Mozart's most exquisite
      compositions. The scene changes completely with the entrance of the
      disguised physician, and the key of the dominant G major, following the
      close in C minor, makes the same impression of freshness as the
      introduction of an entirely new element.<a href="#linknote41-61"
      name="linknoteref41-61" id="linknoteref41-61"> 61 </a> All is now
      animation and life&mdash;question and answer are rapidly exchanged, help
      is asked for and given, and in the midst stands the charlatan playing out
      the farce with due solemnity, and infusing the whole scene with wit and
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the completion of the pretended cure, the lovers again come to the
      foreground and express their passion in extravagant ravings; the
      reluctance of the ladies, in spite of Despina's and Don Alfonso's
      persuasions, again gives a comic tone to the situation, contributing to
      the production of an ensemble singularly rich in contrasting sentiments.
      The orchestra again serves as a groundwork, and an original and persistent
      violin figure gives the andante a strange, somewhat solemn character, with
      which the voices frequently contrast in a manner highly suggestive of the
      situation. The instrumentation also lends its aid. Not only are the
      stringed instruments here employed so differently to the preceding
      movement that they scarcely seem the same instruments; but, whereas oboes
      with flutes and bassoons <span class="side">THE SECOND FINALE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p271.png">[271]</a></span>
      predominated in the former case, here clarinets and bassoons are
      reinforced by trumpets with highly original effect. The tone-colouring
      alters completely at the commencement of the allegro. The flutes in unison
      with the violins, and the tremolo quaver accompaniment, express a decree
      of sensual excitement which contrasts strikingly with the calm, exalted
      tone of the andante. The lovers awaking from their trance and demanding a
      kiss, the sisters are transported with an indignation far more intense
      than that excited by the first encounter. Don Alfonso and Despina seek to
      pacify them, and an unwilling suspicion that the very violence of the
      resentment argues against its absolute sincerity modifies in the minds of
      the lovers the comic impression of the whole scene. The dramatic
      characterisation of all these opposing elements, the well-defined grouping
      of the characters, the force and fire with which the climax is worked up,
      and the tumult of excited emotions with which the finale ends, give it a
      place above the corresponding first finale in "Figaro," and on a level
      with that in "Don Giovanni."
    </p>
    <p>
      The second finale begins with the wedding ceremony, which is charmingly
      and graphically depicted. Despina, who is joined by Don Alfonso, gives
      directions to the servants for the reception of the bridal party, and the
      whole of the first movement sparkles with life and gaiety, preparing the
      way for the festive chorus in which the two couples are presently
      welcomed. Then follows the endearing talk of the lovers, who seat
      themselves at table, drink to each other, and finally join in an amorous
      canon. This is a trait taken from the social manners of the time (Vol.
      II., p. 362), just as the independent treatment of the wind instruments
      during the whole scene represents the customary table music.<a
      href="#linknote41-62" name="linknoteref41-62" id="linknoteref41-62"> 62
      </a> A startling enharmonic transition (from A flat major to E major)
      transports us out of this lovesick mood, and the scene which follows with
      the notary is as full of humour as that with the physician, although the
      context <span class="side">COSÎ FAN TUTTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p272.png">[272]</a></span> necessitates greater moderation
      of tone; it is effectively interrupted by the distant chorus proclaiming
      the return of the warriors. The consternation and confusion which ensue
      have no real interest for the audience, who are aware of what the issue
      must be; the plot is therefore hurried rapidly to an end, and does not
      admit of any connected musical treatment. The composer has been forced to
      content himself with bringing out certain points, such as the feigned
      terror of Don Alfonso, the real alarm of the ladies, and the joyful
      greetings of the returning lovers. The situation becomes more piquant when
      Despina unmasks, and when the lovers discover themselves as the pretended
      Albanians; and Mozart has rendered both these points with true musical
      humour. But the purely musical interest does not reassert its sway until
      the reconciliation has taken place, and a feeling of peace and happiness
      is diffused around. The last movement more especially is full of such calm
      and melodious beauty that we feel lifted above the vanity and triviality
      of so much that has gone before, and left with an impression of heartfelt
      gaiety and satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nearer examination of the opera shows that the libretto, never rising
      above the ordinary opera buffa, has not seldom dragged the music down to
      its own level. The caricature and exaggeration indispensable to this
      species of comic drama have indeed been made by Mozart, as far as
      possible, the natural outcomes of the situations and characters, and are
      thus justified as an artistic element of the work, but he has not been
      able altogether to avoid the substitution of external stage devices for
      psychological truth. The attempt is more visible in this work than in any
      other to render the meaning of the words through the senses; the
      accompaniment is especially rich in detail-painting, instead of being, as
      in Mozart's other works, called upon to add the more delicate shades of
      emotional characterisation. In the duet between Guillelmo and Dorabella
      (23) the orchestra gives the heart-beats which are made the chief point of
      the words; in the lovely terzet (10) the raging of wind and waves, and in
      the preceding quintet (9) the sobs, are distinctly expressed. Even
      subordinate ideas are represented <span class="side">GENERAL CRITIQUE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p273.png">[273]</a></span> after
      the same realistic manner, as, among others, the drawing of the swords in
      the first terzet, the flourish of trumpets and clinking of glasses in the
      third, the piping and cannon reports in the war chorus (8), the beating of
      the heart in Dorabella's air (28) suggested by the quavers on the oboe,
      and the general clinking of glasses in the last finale by the pizzicato of
      the violins.<a href="#linknote41-63" name="linknoteref41-63"
      id="linknoteref41-63"> 63 </a> These are all pleasing touches, introduced
      without injury to more important features, but they do not reach to the
      same height of psychological characterisation which we are wont to admire
      in Mozart's operas. Other devices of opera buffa are more constantly
      employed here than elsewhere, especially rapidity of speech; but, on the
      other hand, there is no trace of any attempt at imitating national
      peculiarities, even when the disguises assumed might have given rise to
      it; Mozart could not but feel that a musical disguise of the kind would
      very soon, fatigue the audience. The effort to cater to the taste of the
      public goes hand in hand with submission to the dictates of the singers,
      and we find their influence far more visible in "Cosi fan Tutte" than in
      "Figaro" or "Don Giovanni." There is an evident effort to please
      individual taste in the concerted airs, and in the unusually light and
      pleasing melodies; such concessions cause this opera, more than any other,
      to resemble the best works of Italian masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar qualities of Mozart's nature, his refinement and nobility of
      thought, his wealth of productivity, and his marvellous technical
      knowledge, are as distinctly marked in this opera as elsewhere. The
      planning, the construction, the grouping of parts, are so firm, so
      transparently clear, that we follow even the most complicated movements
      with ease. The freedom and pliancy of the disposition of parts, where
      there occurs a combination of different characteristic melodies, the easy
      dexterity displayed in the employment of contrapuntal forms, co-operate to
      excite and rivet the attention of the hearer, without causing him any
      sense of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality, however, which delights us more than any other in this opera
      is its delicate sense of beautiful sound, <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p274.png">[274]</a></span> and the ease with which this
      sense is made evident throughout. It is a quality, no doubt, inseparable
      from inventive power and a talent for construction, but it is not
      universally effective in the same degree, and it is rare to find such a
      union of the forces which regulate the impression made by musical beauty
      upon the senses. Even the orchestra, although deficient in the delicate
      detail of "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni," is in other respects fuller, more
      brilliant, and richer in separate instrumental effects. The wind
      instruments are brought more forward, in more varied combinations and
      finer shades of tone-colouring. The clarinets are made effective, and a
      characteristic distinction made between their employment and that of the
      oboes. An original use is made of the trumpets: apart from drums they are
      not trumpet-like in the ordinary sense, but are used in place of the horns
      (not in combination with them), and mostly in the lower registers, in
      order to give freshness and force to the tone-colouring. Similar
      observations might be extended to show in detail with what refined
      penetration and correct judgment of effect the forces of the orchestra are
      made to conduce to the euphonious charm of the opera. That "Cosi fan
      Tutte," considered as a whole, and in respect of importance and detail of
      characterisation, is inferior to "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni," no competent
      critic will deny. Nevertheless many separate portions of the work, and the
      large majority of the characters, display Mozart's genius and mastery of
      his art in full measure of originality and brilliancy, and in many
      respects this opera may be held to indicate an important step in advance
      of all that has gone before it.

      THE accession of Leopold II. to the Imperial throne (March 13, 1790) was
      not an event of good omen for music and the opera. Up to the month of July
      he had not entered the theatre, nor had any private concerts, nor <span
      class="side">MOZART'S POSITION AT COURT, 1790.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p275.png">[275]</a></span> displayed any sort of partiality
      for music; his consort, the Empress Louise, visited the opera and laid
      claim to some musical knowledge, although she expressed herself
      dissatisfied with the state of music in Vienna; the young princes, too,
      were instructed in music.<a href="#linknote42-1" name="linknoteref42-1"
      id="linknoteref42-1"> 1 </a> The difference between Joseph and his
      successor in point of taste was very soon manifested by the reintroduction
      of ballets, and by the favour bestowed on opera seria as well as opera
      buffa. It was rumoured that a new court theatre was to be built, in which
      the boxes were to be arranged for card-playing, and that Salieri had
      determined in consequence to resign his post, which was to be filled by
      Cimarosa.<a href="#linknote42-2" name="linknoteref42-2"
      id="linknoteref42-2"> 2 </a> Those individuals who had enjoyed the esteem
      of Joseph had little favour to hope for from Leopold; a fact which soon
      became evident in matters theatrical. Count Rosenberg was removed from the
      management, which was intrusted to Count Ugarte;<a href="#linknote42-3"
      name="linknoteref42-3" id="linknoteref42-3"> 3 </a> Da Ponte and Madame
      Ferraresi fell into disfavour;<a href="#linknote42-4"
      name="linknoteref42-4" id="linknoteref42-4"> 4 </a> Salieri thought it
      advisable to retire from the conductorship of the opera, and his place was
      filled by Jos. Weigl, "that the master might be reverenced in the pupil."<a
      href="#linknote42-5" name="linknoteref42-5" id="linknoteref42-5"> 5 </a>
      Mozart had stood too high in the favour of Joseph to be able to expect
      much from Leopold II.; his candidature for the post of second
      kapellmeister was as little successful as his request to be honoured with
      the musical instruction of the princes. Proof positive of the low esteem
      in which he was held by the court was afforded to him on the occasion of
      the visit of King Ferdinand of Naples, who came to Vienna (September 14)
      with his Queen, Caroline, to celebrate the marriages of his daughters,
      Maria Theresa and Louise, with the Archdukes Francis and Ferdinand.
      Ferdinand's <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span

      were music and the chase;<a href="#linknote42-6" name="linknoteref42-6"
      id="linknoteref42-6"> 6 </a> and the instrument which he most affected was
      the lute. In his honour a new opera by Weigl ("La Cafetiera Bizarra") was
      performed (September 15);<a href="#linknote42-7" name="linknoteref42-7"
      id="linknoteref42-7"> 7 </a> the Emperor made his first appearance at the
      opera with King Ferdinand, when Salieri's "Axur" was played (September
      21); in honour of the weddings, open table was held in the great
      Redoutensaal, and a concert performed in the gallery under Salieri's
      direction, in which Cavalieri and Calvesi and the brothers Stadler took
      part, and a symphony by Haydn was performed which the King knew by heart,
      and sang out loud as it was played; Haydn was introduced to him, invited
      to Naples, and honoured with commands for compositions;<a
      href="#linknote42-8" name="linknoteref42-8" id="linknoteref42-8"> 8 </a>
      and all this time Mozart remained unnoticed, and was not even summoned to
      play before the King of Naples, a neglect which wounded him deeply. His
      condition was painful in the extreme; his wife's delicate health showed no
      signs of improving; and as his expenses increased his income gradually
      diminished. In May he had only two pupils, and was obliged to appeal to
      his friends to assist him in raising the number to eight. His continual
      and pressing embarrassments exhausted even the resources of his
      ever-generous friend Puchberg, and he was obliged to apply to
      money-lenders, and to embark in speculations which did but hasten his
      financial ruin (Vol. II., p. 301). The weight of these cares crippled his
      energies for work, as he himself complains, and no period of his life is
      so poor in artistic production as this year. His own catalogue contains,
      after the completion of "Cosi fan Tutte" in January, 1790, only:&mdash;

    <p>
      In the hope of improving his circumstances, Mozart resumed his plan of
      taking a professional tour; the coronation of Leopold II. in Frankfort, on
      October 9, attracted a large number of strangers to that city, and seemed
      to render it a favourable place for the experiment. Salieri, as court
      kapellmeister,<a href="#linknote42-9" name="linknoteref42-9"
      id="linknoteref42-9"> 9 </a> Ign. Umlauf as his deputy, and fifteen
      chamber musicians, were sent to Frankfort among the retinue of the
      Emperor.<a href="#linknote42-10" name="linknoteref42-10"
      id="linknoteref42-10"> 10 </a> Mozart was not included among the number,
      and thus was deprived of the advantage of the imperial patronage. On
      September 23 he set off, after pawning his silver plate to defray the
      expenses of his journey (Vol. II., p. 301) in company with his
      brother-in-law, the violinist Hofer, whom he took with him out of
      compassion, and with the intention of sharing the expected profits
      together; they travelled in their own carriage, and, arriving in Frankfort
      on the 23rd, had considerable difficulty in finding a lodging, owing to
      the overflow of strangers into the town. On October 14, at noon, Mozart
      gave a concert in the Stadt-theater.<a href="#linknote42-11"
      name="linknoteref42-11" id="linknoteref42-11"> 11 </a> The contrabassist
      Ludwig, long since dead, who took part in the concert, used to tell how
      the piano stood upon the stage, and how during the rehearsal the restless,
      agile little man was continually leaping over the prompter's box into the
      orchestra to chat in a friendly way with the various performers, and then
      climb back again on to the stage. Mozart's own compositions were
      exclusively performed at this concert; he played the concertos in F major
      (459 K.) and D major (537 K.). Margarethe Hamel, afterwards Frau Schick,
      was the vocalist, and so charmed Mozart by her voice and delivery that he
      is said to have exclaimed repeatedly: "I never wish to hear any other
      singing <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p278.png">[278]</a></span> than this."<a
      href="#linknote42-12" name="linknoteref42-12" id="linknoteref42-12"> 12
      </a> It is also said that he played a pianoforte concerto as a duet with
      old "Papa Beecké" (Vol. I., pp. 151,368), whom he met again here.<a
      href="#linknote42-13" name="linknoteref42-13" id="linknoteref42-13"> 13
      </a> He acquaints his wife with the friendly reception accorded him, and
      tradition has it that he struck up a friendship with the concertmeister
      Hoffmann, and generally spent the evening with him at Gran's tavern in the
      Bleidenstrasse. Hesse became acquainted in Frankfort, as he tells us,<a
      href="#linknote42-14" name="linknoteref42-14" id="linknoteref42-14"> 14
      </a> with an old superannuated organist of the Katharinenkirche, who in
      1790 had been the pupil of his predecessor; the old man said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday, after service, Mozart came into the choir at St Katharine's,
      and begged the old organist to allow him to play something. He seated
      himself on the stool and gave the reins to his fancy, when the organist
      suddenly pushed him off the stool in the rudest manner, and said to the
      pupil standing by: "Mark that last modulation which Herr Mozart made; how
      can he profess to be a musician and commit such grave offences against
      correct composition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pupil had remembered the modulation, and Hesse thought it a fine one,
      and not even unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Frankfort Mozart proceeded to Mayence. Here rumour assigned him a
      touching love intrigue, which was supposed to have suggested the song "Io
      ti lascio," the said song having been in reality composed by Gottfried von
      Jacquin in Vienna, and not by Mozart at all (Vol. II., p. 361). On his way
      back to Frankfort, Mozart stayed at Mannheim, and renewed the memory of
      former days with as many of the old friends as still survived. He arrived
      just in time for the first performance of his "Figaro," which took place
      on October 24. The actor Backhaus notes in his Tagebuch der Mann-heimer
      Schaubühne: "I got into great disgrace with Mozart. I was standing at the
      door while our rehearsal was going on. He came and asked me about it, and
      whether he might hear it. I took him for a little journeyman tailor, and
      refused to let him in. 'You will surely allow Kapellmeister Mozart to hear
      the rehearsal?' So I was in a scrape most decidedly."<a

      The late organist of the Trinitatiskirche, Schultz, delighted as an
      octogenarian to recall how Mozart, who visited his father and played the
      organ with him, censured the slow tempi of the Kapellmeister Fränzel at
      the rehearsal in the theatre, and gave it himself with more animation.
      Otherwise, Mozart pronounced himself highly satisfied with the cast and
      the performance.<a href="#linknote42-16" name="linknoteref42-16"

      At Munich, where Mozart arrived on October 29, and took up his quarters
      with his old friend Albert,<a href="#linknote42-17" name="linknoteref42-17"
      id="linknoteref42-17"> 17 </a> he found still more of the old set, and his
      letters to his wife show the pleasure he took in their society. Here at
      last he had the gratification of being requested by the Elector to play at
      the concert which was given at court to the King of Naples, who was
      staying at Munich for two days<a href="#linknote42-18"
      name="linknoteref42-18" id="linknoteref42-18"> 18 </a> on his return
      journey from Frankfort. "Highly creditable to the Vienna court," he
      writes, "that the King should hear me in a foreign country." Shortly after
      Mozart's return to Vienna Salomon arrived from London, and made what might
      at that time be considered brilliant proposals to Haydn to accompany him
      to England, and produce that series of compositions for the Philharmonic
      Society which were destined to lay the foundation of Haydn's fame and
      prosperity. Salomon made repeated propositions to Mozart also to undertake
      the journey to London under similar conditions, as soon as Haydn should
      return. It was with a heavy heart that Mozart bade adieu to his dear "Papa
      Haydn," the only artist in Vienna who really understood him and wished him
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may safely be asserted that Mozart did not return to Vienna with a full
      purse, nor did his other financial operations secure for him that for
      which he so touchingly expresses to his wife his ardent longing: a mind
      free from anxiety, and permission to work&mdash;only to work. He did work,
      though, <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p280.png">[280]</a></span> after his return, and the last
      year of his life displays an activity which passes belief. His own list
      contains:&mdash;

      unermesslichen Weltalls Schopfer" (619 K.).
    </p>
    <p>
      A glance at this catalogue is sufficient to prove that he wrote whatever
      he was requested, either by commission or to please his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his own playing, no doubt at a concert, he wrote the pianoforte
      concerto in B flat major, which like most of the compositions of this
      period, is distinguished by its mild and earnest tone and charming
      euphony. The two fine quintets for stringed instruments were written "at
      the earnest solicitation of a musical friend" (Vol. III., p. 18) who was
      no doubt acquainted with Mozart's poor circumstances, and wished to afford
      him a worthy opportunity of turning his art to account. The spirit in
      which Mozart undertook commissions which were often of a very subordinate
      nature may be best seen in his composition for a mechanical timepiece
      which was ordered by Count Deym for Müller's art-collection, then
      attracting great attention. The serious temper which it displays, and
      <span class="side">BADEN, 1791&mdash;STOLL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p281.png">[281]</a></span> the thoroughly technical
      treatment of the composition, betray no evidence of a work merely done to
      order. Another occasional composition is the beautiful chorus with
      stringed quartet accompaniment, "Ave verum corpus." Mozart's wife was
      staying at Baden for the waters in the summer of 1790, and again in 1791,
      in company with her sister Sophie. There Mozart became acquainted with the
      schoolmaster and choirmaster Stoll, an ardent admirer, who took pleasure
      in making himself useful to Mozart and his wife. That Stoll could
      appreciate the fun of Mozart, in his unrestrained moods, is shown by the
      superscription of a note (July 12, 1791)&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Liebster Stoll!
     Bester Knoll!
     Grösster Schroll!
     Bist Stemvoll!
     Gelt das Moll!
     Thut dir wohl!
</pre>
    <p>
      or by his assurance in another letter: "This is the stupidest letter which
      I ever wrote in my life; but it is just fitted for you." On the other
      hand, Mozart was of use to him with his compositions, and lent him, among
      others, his Masses in B flat major (275 K.) and C major (317 K.) for
      performance. On one of these occasions the soprano singer turned
      obstinate, and would not obey Mozart's directions. He sent her away, and
      gave the part to his little favourite, Antonia Huber, a child of ten or
      eleven years old, who was often with her brother-in-law Stoll and met
      Mozart at his house. He practised with the child for a week, and her
      industry and attention were so great that she performed her part to
      admiration, and was rewarded by Mozart with "Brav, Tonerl, recht brav!"
      together with a kiss and a ducat. He used to say to her, "Tonerl, make
      haste and grow big, and I will take you with me to Vienna."<a
      href="#linknote42-19" name="linknoteref42-19" id="linknoteref42-19"> 19
      </a> The "Ave verum corpus" was no doubt composed at Stoll's suggestion
      during one of these visits to Baden. It bears tokens of haste, but is so
      full of childlike piety, winning simplicity, and entrancing harmony, <span
      class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p282.png">[282]</a></span> that one seems for the moment
      transported from all earthly doubts and cares into a region of heavenly
      calm and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very different impression is made by the bass air with obbligato
      double-bass, composed by Mozart for two professional friends. The
      celebrated double-bass player, Pischlberger, was in Schikaneder's
      orchestra, and Gerl and his wife (formerly Mdlle. Reisinger) sang at the
      same theatre. Contemporaries affirmed that the very pretty and attractive
      woman had completely entangled Mozart in her coils. Be that as it may,
      this composition was the cause of a connection between Mozart and
      Schikaneder which was fertile in results to the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel Schikaneder was born in poor circumstances at Regensburg in 1751.
      He was obliged as a boy to earn his living as a wandering musician, and in
      1773 was so inspired by the performances of a wandering troupe of actors
      at Augsburg that he joined them. He afterwards married Eleonore Artim, the
      adopted daughter of his manager, and undertook the management. He had
      considerable skill and audacity, not only as an actor and singer, but also
      as a dramatic poet. His company visited by turns Inspruck, Laibach, Gratz,<a
      href="#linknote42-20" name="linknoteref42-20" id="linknoteref42-20"> 20
      </a> Pressburg, Pesth, and Salzburg, where he had become acquainted with
      the Mozarts in 1780, and had suggested some compositions to Wolfgang (Vol.
      II., p. 102). His want of refinement in the choice of means of attraction
      is sufficiently proved by his having on one occasion at Salzburg, when
      "Agnes Bernauer" was performed, made the public announcement: "The Vidame
      will this day be thrown over the bridge "&mdash;which concession to the
      moral feelings of his audience was duly made the same evening.<a
      href="#linknote42-21" name="linknoteref42-21" id="linknoteref42-21"> 21
      </a> He acquired a considerable competence, but an unlucky speculation in
      Pressburg ruined him. He had written a piece in which a goose played the
      principal part, and all the others were cocks and hens. The expenses for
      scenery and costumes were very great, and, as it was a complete failure,
      his finances were <span class="side">SCHIKANEDER.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p283.png">[283]</a></span> irretrievably
      injured. In November, 1784, he gained access for his company to the stage
      of the Karnthnerthortheater in Vienna, where he gave German operas and
      plays, at which the Emperor was occasionally present.<a
      href="#linknote42-22" name="linknoteref42-22" id="linknoteref42-22"> 22
      </a> He appeared on April 1, 1785, in the part of Schwindel in Gluck's
      "Pil-grimmen von Mecca"; but attempting greater parts in serious drama, he
      was hissed off the stage, and in February, 1786, was forced to leave
      Vienna.<a href="#linknote42-23" name="linknoteref42-23"
      id="linknoteref42-23"> 23 </a> He then took the town theatre in
      Regensburg, and endeavoured to satisfy the taste of the populace for low
      comedy; but this did not last long, and in the summer of 1787 he threw up
      the undertaking<a href="#linknote42-24" name="linknoteref42-24"
      id="linknoteref42-24"> 24 </a> and returned to Vienna. His wife had in the
      meantime remained at the theatre in the "Freihause auf der Wieden,"<a
      href="#linknote42-25" name="linknoteref42-25" id="linknoteref42-25"> 25
      </a> and had taken the management of it from Friedel. This now passed into
      Schikaneder's hands, and in these confined premises&mdash;little better
      than a barn&mdash;he succeeded in delighting the Viennese public with
      performances expressly designed to attract them, especially comic operas,
      of which many were highly successful.<a href="#linknote42-26"
      name="linknoteref42-26" id="linknoteref42-26"> 26 </a> What he wanted in
      cultivation (he could barely write or reckon) he made up for in sound
      mother-wit, practical experience, and knowledge of stage routine. His
      audacity was equal to his frivolity, and he found a way out of every
      dilemma. He was addicted to sensual gratification, a parasite and a
      spendthrift; and in spite of his large income was often hard pressed by
      his creditors.<a href="#linknote42-27" name="linknoteref42-27"
      id="linknoteref42-27"> 27 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of these periods of embarrassment, in the spring of 1791<a
      href="#linknote42-28" name="linknoteref42-28" id="linknoteref42-28"> 28
      </a> (May 7 is given as the date), he had recourse <span class="side">LABOUR
      AND POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p284.png">[284]</a></span>
      to Mozart, with whom he had renewed the old acquaintance, and representing
      to him that he was lost unless he could produce an opera of great
      attractive power, he assured him that he had discovered an excellent magic
      subject for an opera, which Mozart was just the man to compose. Mozart's
      irresistible inclination for operatic composition, his natural good-nature
      and regard for a brother Freemason, and, as it was said, the influence of
      Madame Gerl, all combined to induce him to make the attempt: "If we make a
      fiasco, I cannot help it, for I never wrote a magic opera in my life."
      Schikaneder gave him the first sketch of the "Zauberflöte," and, knowing
      how difficult it was to bring Mozart to the point of writing, he arranged
      a little garden-house in the courtyard of the Freihaus for his use, so as
      to keep him under his own eye. Here, and in Josephsdorf, on the Kahlenberg
      (where his room in the casino is still shown),<a href="#linknote42-29"
      name="linknoteref42-29" id="linknoteref42-29"> 29 </a> Mozart wrote the
      greater part of the "Zauberflöte"; Schikaneder was at hand to discuss
      points of detail, to make necessary alterations, and above all to have his
      own part written to his mind. He had a poor bass voice, was uncultivated,
      but not unmusical, and could execute his songs in a dashing and effective
      manner. He knew perfectly in what consisted his best effects, and insisted
      on having simple, popular melodies, which Mozart was compliant enough to
      go on altering until Schikaneder was satisfied. The song "Ein Mädchen oder
      Weibchen," after many attempts, was, it is said, suggested by a melody
      hummed by Schikaneder himself. It has been remarked that the beginning is
      identical with the seventh and eighth lines of Scandelli's (d. 1580)
      chorale, "Nun lob mein Seel den Herren"&mdash;[See Page Image] is sung to
      the same melody<a href="#linknote42-30" name="linknoteref42-30"
      id="linknoteref42-30"> 30 </a>&mdash;a sure proof of its popularity. The
      duets "Bei Männern welche Liebe fühlen," and <span class="side">COMPOSITION
      OF THE "ZAUBERFLOTE."</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p285.png">[285]</a></span> "Papageno" were repeatedly
      rearranged in deference to Schika-neder's wish. His want of any hesitation
      in the matter is proved by the following note from him, preserved by Al.
      Fuchs in his collection:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Wolfgang,&mdash;Herewith I return your "Pa-Pa-Pa-," which I like
      fairly well. It will do, at any rate. We shall meet this evening at the
      usual place.&mdash;Yours, E. Schikaneder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Schikaneder took care to keep his composer in good humour by frequent
      invitations to his table; where both eating and drinking were of the best,
      and by introductions to the jovial and free-living society in which he
      himself moved, and which also included A. Stadler, the man who so
      shamefully abused Mozart's good nature (Vol. II., p. 309). The pressure of
      external circumstances, of growing domestic troubles, and the bitter
      feeling of failure and disappointed hope, combined with his own excitable
      nature to cause Mozart to seek for distraction and forgetfulness in the
      whirl of a pleasure-loving life. His wife was at Baden, where his youngest
      son Wolfgang was born on July 26; her absence deprived his home life of
      any comfort, and drove him to take refuge among his theatrical friends.
      Folly and dissipation were the inevitable accompaniments of such an
      existence, and these soon reached the public ear, combining with the
      exaggerated accounts current of the loose life led by Schikaneder and his
      associates to cover Mozart's name for several months with an amount of
      obloquy beyond what he deserved (Vol. II., p. 270). While the
      "Zauberflöte" was in course of composition, Da Ponte, who was obliged to
      leave Vienna, tried to persuade Mozart to accompany him to London, and
      there take an active part in the production of Italian opera. Mozart
      turned a favourable ear to the project, but demanded a delay of six months
      for the completion and performance of his opera, to which Da Ponte could
      not agree.<a href="#linknote42-31" name="linknoteref42-31"
      id="linknoteref42-31"> 31 </a> In July, 1791, the work was so far advanced
      that he was able to insert the opera in his catalogue as virtually
      complete; the rehearsals had begun as <span class="side">LABOUR AND
      POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p286.png">[286]</a></span>
      soon as the voices and bass parts were ready, the working-out of the
      instrumentation being left, as usual, to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture that Mozart received an unexpected commission in a
      very singular manner.<a href="#linknote42-32" name="linknoteref42-32"
      id="linknoteref42-32"> 32 </a> A stranger, a tall, thin grave-looking man,
      dressed from head to foot in grey, and calculated from his very appearance
      to make a striking and weird impression, presented him one day with an
      anonymous letter begging him with many flattering allusions to his
      accomplishments as an artist to name his price for composing a Requiem,
      and the shortest time in which he could undertake to complete it. Mozart
      acquainted his wife with the circumstance, and assured her that it gave
      him great satisfaction, since he had long wished to try his powers once
      more on this species of composition, and to produce a work that both
      friends and foes might admire and study after his death. The innovations
      in church music introduced by the Emperor Joseph had been swept away by
      his successor, and the services of the Church were once more performed
      after the old fashion. Mozart was anxious therefore to impress upon the
      Emperor Leopold II., as the supreme arbiter, his familiarity with the
      orthodox church style, and the present seemed a favourable opportunity for
      the purpose. After consultation with his wife he announced his readiness
      to undertake the commission, but without fixing a term for its completion,
      and naming as his price 50 (some say 100) ducats; whereupon the messenger
      again appeared, paid the stipulated sum, and promised an addition on the
      delivery of the finished work. Mozart was enjoined to compose the Requiem
      according to his own will and pleasure, and to make <span class="side">COMMISSION
      FOR THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p287.png">[287]</a></span>
      no endeavour to discover his mysterious patron, an endeavour which would
      certainly prove in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now proved beyond doubt that Count Franz von Wal-segg of Stuppach
      was the patron in question, and that he ordered the Requiem in memory of
      his late wife, Anna Edlen von Flammberg; the mysterious messenger was his
      steward Leutgeb, whose personal appearance has been described to me by
      Grillparzer. Count Walsegg was a zealous lover of music, a good flautist,
      and a moderately good violoncello-player; he had quartet parties every
      Tuesday and Thursday, and theatrical performances every Sunday, in which
      his family and retainers took active part. But he was also ambitious to
      figure as a composer. He used to order quartets from different composers,
      always anonymously and with the offer of handsome payment;<a
      href="#linknote42-33" name="linknoteref42-33" id="linknoteref42-33"> 33
      </a> these he would then copy with his own hand, and have the parts
      written out from this score. After performance he would set the players to
      guess the composer; they, fully aware of the mystification, invariably
      flattered his weakness by guessing himself, and he with a deprecating
      smile would tacitly admit the imputation. This explains the mysterious
      origin of the Requiem. He rewrote Mozart's score, gave the parts to be
      copied from his duplicate (with the title of "Requiem composto del Conte
      Walsegg"), and himself directed the performance of it on December 14,
      1793.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Mozart had set himself in earnest to this task, he received in the
      middle of August a fresh commission which brooked of no delay. A festival
      opera was to be performed at the approaching coronation of Leopold II. as
      King of Bohemia in Prague. The subject chosen was Metastasio's "Clemenza
      di Tito," and again it was the people of Prague who made good the
      deficiencies of the Viennese: the States called upon Mozart to compose the
      opera. For reasons which do not appear their decision was so long delayed
      that there remained only a few weeks for the composition and rehearsal
      <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p288.png">[288]</a></span> of the opera. After making all
      preliminary arrangements, Mozart set out for Prague. As he was in the act
      of stepping into the travelling-carriage with his wife, the mysterious
      messenger appeared, and touching his wife on the arm, asked how it would
      fare with the Requiem now. Mozart excused himself by alleging the
      necessity of his present journey, and the impossibility of acquainting his
      unknown patron with it, and promised that it should be his first work on
      his return if the delay were granted him; with this the messenger declared
      himself satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart worked at his opera during the journey, making sketches in the
      carriage, and working them out at the inn where they stopped for the
      night. He must have intended the part of Sextus to be taken by a tenor,
      for in two sketches of the duets with Vitellia (i) and Annius (3) Sextus
      is a tenor, which of course necessitated a plan and treatment altogether
      different. He cannot have received definite instructions as to the cast of
      the opera until he was in Prague; but then he set to work with so much
      ardour that in the course of eighteen days the opera was finished and in
      rehearsal.<a href="#linknote42-34" name="linknoteref42-34"
      id="linknoteref42-34"> 34 </a> He called in the assistance of a young
      composer named Franz Süssmayr, one of his pupils, who is said to have
      written the secco recitatives; what makes this the more probable is the
      fact that in the original score there is no secco recitative at all. But
      the further assertion that Süssmayr composed the airs for Servilia,
      Annius, and Publius, and arranged the instrumentation of some other
      pieces,<a href="#linknote42-35" name="linknoteref42-35"
      id="linknoteref42-35"> 35 </a> is disproved by the existence of almost all
      the numbers in Mozart's handwriting.<a href="#linknote42-36"

      The Empress is said to have expressed herself very disdainfully concerning
      the "porcheria" of German music; and it is certain that the first
      performance of "Titus" was far from being a success.<a
      href="#linknote42-39" name="linknoteref42-39" id="linknoteref42-39"> 39
      </a> Niemetschek is of opinion (p. 112) that the public were too excited
      by the gorgeous coronation festivities to be disposed to listen to the
      calmer beauties of Mozart's music. Mozart, accustomed to find consolation
      for so much slighting indifference in the enthusiastic applause of the
      Prague audiences, was thoroughly cast down by his failure; the more so as
      he was unwell when he arrived, and his indisposition had been increased by
      his extraordinary exertions. He was continually taking medicine and looked
      pale and depressed, although, as Niemetschek says, his gaiety shone forth
      bright as ever in the congenial society of his Prague friends; at his
      parting from the familiar circle he was so overcome as to shed tears.<a

      If it be true that "Cosi fan Tutte" is in all essential points an opera
      buffa, it is no less certain that "Titus" may take its stand as a
      veritable opera seria. Metastasio wrote "La Clemenza di Tito" in 1734, and
      it was performed with Caldara's music on the name-day of Charles VI.; it
      was subsequently set to music by several distinguished composers.<a
      href="#linknote42-41" name="linknoteref42-41" id="linknoteref42-41"> 41
      </a> It is true that the public taste had so far altered that it was
      scarcely feasible to present it in its original form; but the improvements
      in the libretto, made by Caterino Mazzola, the Saxon court poet,<a
      href="#linknote42-42" name="linknoteref42-42" id="linknoteref42-42"> 42
      </a> did not affect the character of the opera in any important degree.
      The principal change was the compression of the original three acts into
      two, and the omission of a not very happy episode, in which Annius, by a
      change of mantle, is taken for the guilty person. The course of the plot
      is thereby simplified; but it would be impossible by means of alterations
      to endow it with any lively dramatic interest. Nor is it rich in good
      musical situations; of all the characters Vitellia is the only one who
      displays the least passion; and the excessive amount of virtue and
      generosity depicted affords no field either for musical or dramatic
      interest. Further condensations were made of the numerous and, for the
      most part, rhetorically sententious solo airs, and ensemble movements were
      introduced at suitable points. This was accomplished with all possible
      deference to the original design and to Metastasio's verses, so that the
      character and colouring proper to a court festival piece was well
      preserved.<a href="#linknote42-43" name="linknoteref42-43"

      <span class="side">PLOT OF "TITUS."</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p291.png">[291]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vitellia, daughter of Vitellius, who has been deposed by Vespasian, has
      nourished the hope of a union with Titus, but finding herself
      disappointed, she wishes young Sextus, who is passionately in love with
      her, to form a conspiracy against his friend Titus, and by his overthrow
      to gain her hand. At the beginning of the opera she is urging her wavering
      lover to action, when Annius brings the unexpected tidings that Titus has
      banished his mistress Berenice from Rome. He entreats Sextus to obtain the
      consent of Titus to his union with Servilia, the sister of Sextus, who
      willingly promises his aid. After a magnificent assembly of the people, in
      which the generosity of Titus is publicly displayed, the Emperor himself
      demands from Sextus the hand of his sister Servilia; Sextus is confused
      and silent, but Annius, by his generous praise of the virtues and beauty
      of Servilia, strengthens the Emperor in his decision. Servilia, however,
      informed by Annius of the honour in store for her, assures him of her
      unalterable love, and, hastening to Titus, confesses to him the whole
      truth, whereupon he generously resigns her, and unites her to Annius.
      Vitellia, incensed to the highest degree by the proposed elevation of
      Servilia, directs Sextus and his coconspirators to proceed at once to
      action. He obeys, but has scarcely left her presence, when Publius, leader
      of her body-guard, enters, and summons her to the palace to bestow her
      hand upon Titus; she hastens to the palace in the utmost dismay and
      consternation. There is a general encounter in front of the capitol, which
      has been set on fire by the conspirators; great excitement prevails, and
      turns to grief and horror at the tidings brought by Sextus of the death of
      the Emperor, whom he believes himself to have slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second act, Sextus, a prey to remorse, confesses his guilt to
      Annius, who counsels flight, and is supported by Vitellia with an eye to
      her own safety; Publius enters and arrests Sextus on the testimony of some
      imprisoned conspirators. At a meeting of the senators, who bewail the
      death of Titus, the latter steps forth from among the people, throws off
      the disguise in which he had saved himself, and is recognised amid general
      rejoicings.<a href="#linknote42-44" name="linknoteref42-44"
      id="linknoteref42-44"> 44 </a> He knows that Sextus intended to
      assassinate him, and has been condemned to death by the senate, but
      summoning him to his presence, he offers him a free pardon in return for a
      full confession. Sextus, unwilling to inculpate Vitellia, maintains an
      obstinate silence, and Titus finally ratifies the sentence of death.
      Vitellia yields to the entreaties of Servilia to intercede with the
      Emperor for Sextus, renounces her hopes, and resolves to save him by
      confessing her own guilt. All being prepared in the amphitheatre for the
      execution of Sextus, it is about to take place, when Vitellia rushes in,
      and denounces herself as the originator of the revolt; Titus pardons her a
      well as Sextus and the conspirators; all present extol his clemency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p292.png">[292]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the plot and the characters are absolutely devoid of dramatic
      interest. The abstract goodness of Titus, who is ready on every occasion
      to pardon and to yield, rouses no sympathy,<a href="#linknote42-45"
      name="linknoteref42-45" id="linknoteref42-45"> 45 </a> and is dramatically
      mischievous in its effects, since it destroys any sort of suspense.
      Publius, Annius and Servilia are mere props in the plot, characters
      without any individuality. Sextus is a purely passive instrument, wavering
      between love and remorse, without force or decision. We should sympathise
      with him if his love for Vitellia were returned, and if a healthy passion
      gave an impulse to his crime; but his weakness, which prevents his being
      aware that he is only the instrument of her selfish passion, deprives him
      of all sympathy, while Vitellia repels us by her barefaced ambition, to
      which she is ready to sacrifice every sentiment and every duty; her
      remorse comes too late to appear anything but a dissonance leading to the
      inevitable conclusion of the plot. This internal weakness in the
      characters is emphasised by Metastasio's poetical treatment of the plot.
      His dainty style was specially suited for court poetry and its
      corresponding musical expression, and his dexterity in the handling of the
      accepted forms of composition made his task a comparatively easy one. But
      even without taking into account the revolution which had taken place in
      the drama, we may judge from "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni" that what in
      Metastasio's time was of advantage to the composer had now become fetters
      binding him to forms and dogmas which were virtually obsolete. We find
      traces throughout of the opera seria, which Mozart had abandoned long ago,
      but which he was constrained here to resume. Metastasio's graceful
      daintiness of style, too, was even more injurious in the taste it
      encouraged for mere amusement of the trifling kind that was looked for at
      the opera at that time, giving an unseemly effeminacy of tone to the opera
      seria, and running an equal risk of degenerating into mere trifling or
      empty pomp and show. If, in addition to this, it be remembered that
      Mozart's express directions were to compose an occasional, a festival
      opera, for which two singers had <span class="side">TITUS OVERTURE&mdash;ENSEMBLES.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p293.png">[293]</a></span> been
      summoned from Italy, and would demand to be shown at their best, and that
      he composed the opera against time, and struggling with illness, it will
      scarcely be expected that an unqualified success should follow such a
      combination of untoward circumstances. The character of a brilliant festal
      piece is at once suggested by the overture, which begins appropriately by
      a solemn intrada, with a long-drawn climax. The first bars recall the
      overture to "Idomeneo," which, however, in earnestness and dignity of
      tone, and originality of invention, far surpasses that to "Titus." The
      second theme so announced falls short of expectation, being weak and
      trifling,<a href="#linknote42-46" name="linknoteref42-46"
      id="linknoteref42-46"> 46 </a> and even the subject selected for harmonic
      contrapuntal treatment&mdash;[See Page Image] skilful and brilliant as the
      treatment is, has in itself no special interest, so that when the prelude
      recurs to form an effective conclusion, the principal impression remaining
      is one of brilliant display.
    </p>
    <p>
      The march (4) and the choruses (5, 24) as well as the finale (26) <i>Sestetto
      con coro</i>, in which short solo passages alternate with the chorus,
      maintain this festive character. They are brilliant and flowing, pleasing
      and melodious, and answer for their purpose and the situation without
      laying claim to original invention or characterisation. Only the chorus
      with which Titus is received before he pronounces judgment upon Sextus
      (24) has a fine expression of solemn dignity, suggested not so much by the
      words, which are trivial enough, as by the character of the situation. It
      was a happy touch to make the chorus, after the unexpected deliverance of
      Titus (15), express delight, not with jubilant outcries, but with the
      suppressed joy of bewildered amazement. Nevertheless this chorus is too
      light and fugitive for the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p294.png">[294]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenor part of Titus displays most clearly the influence of the old
      opera seria, Metastasio's words, consisting of general axioms, being
      retained for all his three airs (6, 8, 20). The two first are short and
      melodious, but not deeply suggestive;<a href="#linknote42-47"
      name="linknoteref42-47" id="linknoteref42-47"> 47 </a> the last retains
      the old aria form with a long middle movement and return to the first
      allegro, together with bravura passages quite in the old style. The report
      that the tenor Baglione found that Mozart and not an Italian composer had
      been engaged to write the opera, and that they quarrelled in consequence,<a
      href="#linknote42-48" name="linknoteref42-48" id="linknoteref42-48"> 48
      </a> is the more improbable since Baglione was the same singer for whom
      Mozart had written Don Ottavio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servilia's air (2) indicated, after the old style, with tempo di menuetto,
      the two airs for Annius (13, 17)<a href="#linknote42-49"
      name="linknoteref42-49" id="linknoteref42-49"> 49 </a> and that for
      Publius (16), are all both in design and treatment proper to secondary
      parts, without musical significance or individual characterisation. The
      main weight, therefore, fell according to custom upon the two prime donne,
      who played Sextus and Vitellia. The fact that the parts of the lovers,
      Sextus and Annius, were soprano, was an objectionable relic of the old
      opera seria, and that Sextus should have been played by a female and not a
      male soprano was a progress indeed for humanity, but not for the drama.
      True characterisation is impossible when a woman in man's clothes plays
      the lover, and the case is not improved by the weak, womanish character of
      Sextus. His passion for Vitellia becomes a thing contrary to nature, and
      the deeper the dramatic conception of the part the more repulsively does
      this appear. Of necessity, therefore, vocal execution comes to the
      foreground. The first air of Sextus, "Parto I" (9), fails at once in
      dramatic interest from his having already repeatedly assured Vitellia of
      his blind obedience, if she will only bestow upon <span class="side">TITUS&mdash;SEXTUS.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p295.png">[295]</a></span> him one
      glance of love. The musical design and working-out are those of a grand
      bravura air. Tenderness, tinged with only an occasional dash of heroism,
      prevails throughout the two movements (adagio 3-4 and allegro 4-4). An
      obbligato clarinet goes with the voice, and the strictly concertante
      treatment of this instrument gives its chief interest to the musical
      working-out of the song. Considered as a concert air which treats the
      given situation only as a general foundation for the development of
      musical forces, it is of extraordinary beauty, the melodies being noble
      and expressive, the sound-effects of the voice and clarinet admirable, and
      the only concessions to brilliancy of effect the triplet passages and the
      long-drawn-out conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second air (19) is more definitely characterised by the situation.
      Sextus, having with difficulty withstood Titus's friendly entreaties, is
      overpowered by his feelings when the Emperor turns coldly away, and leaves
      him to be led to death. This air is also in two movements; Sextus
      expresses his grief for the loss of Titus's confidence in an adagio, and
      his despair at the death awaiting him in an allegro. Metastasio's text
      expressed only the latter feeling, and Mazzola formed the first part of
      the air out of the words of the dialogue.<a href="#linknote42-50"
      name="linknoteref42-50" id="linknoteref42-50"> 50 </a> The expression of
      the first movement is fervent and true, and the softness characterising it
      belongs to the character and the situation; the second movement expresses
      a certain amount of passion in some parts, but is as a whole wanting in
      energy, and its chief motif, even for a female Sextus, is too soft and
      tender. Schaul adduces as a proof of Mozart's frequent sins against good
      sense that Sextus, tortured by remorse, should express his agony to Titus
      in a rondo.<a href="#linknote42-51" name="linknoteref42-51"
      id="linknoteref42-51"> 51 </a> "If it were a rondo by Pleyel or Clementi,"
      remarks C. M. von Weber in answer,<a href="#linknote42-52"
      name="linknoteref42-52" id="linknoteref42-52"> 52 </a> "it might indeed
      produce a ludicrous effect; but let the critic only note the heartfelt
      fervour of the song, the depth and beauty of expression in such places as
      'pur saresti men <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p296.png">[296]</a></span> severo, se
      vedesti questo cor, and all such petty fault-finding will cease to be
      heard." Mozart had originally sketched another allegro, the first bars of
      which, still existing in autograph, are rather more decided in character:&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      The page ends here, and the present allegro is begun on a fresh one; it
      cannot be determined whether the first allegro was finished or only
      commenced, but in any case the instrumentation was not worked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vitellia is the only character in the opera displaying anything like
      passion or strength of feeling. The singer Maria Marchetti (b. 1767),
      married to the tenor Fantozzi in 1788, had acquired great renown in Italy
      and Milan, whence she was summoned to Prague; she possessed a fine, full
      voice, and excellent execution and action, enhanced by a pleasing exterior
      and dignified bearing.<a href="#linknote42-53" name="linknoteref42-53"
      id="linknoteref42-53"> 53 </a> In her first air (2) there is indeed no
      passion, Metastasio's words, consisting of frigid moral observations,
      scarcely allowing of any characteristic musical expression. The air is
      divided into the traditional two movements, neither of them distinguished
      by originality, <span class="side">TITUS&mdash;VITELLIA.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p297.png">[297]</a></span> and even the
      bravura part is insignificant; the whole effect is so dry and commonplace
      as involuntarily to suggest Süssmayr. Vitellia's second air, on the
      contrary (22, 23), is the gem of the opera, and incontestably one of the
      most beautiful songs ever written. At the decisive moment Vitellia rises
      to the resolution of renouncing her dearest hopes, of sacrificing her very
      life to the nobler instincts of her soul, which have too long been made to
      yield to her ambitious striving after false greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musical characterisation grasps this situation, and develops from it a
      psychological picture complete in itself, and only loosely connected with
      the earlier conception of Vitellia's character in the opera. The song
      seems thus to be detached from the framework of the opera, and to belong
      rather to the province of concert music. This idea is strengthened by the
      design, treatment, and compass of the two movements, as well as by the
      introduction of the obbligato basset-horn, which is treated so as to
      accord with the voice part, without any brilliant bravura.<a
      href="#linknote42-54" name="linknoteref42-54" id="linknoteref42-54"> 54
      </a> Every element of the song is blended into such perfect unity, such
      charm of melody, such beauty of musical form; the sharp contrasts of the
      different motifs are so admirably expressive of the general character of
      which they form the details, and the whole work is so permeated by the
      breath of poetic genius, that our satisfaction in contemplating a perfect
      work of art leads us to forget how it stands forth as something foreign to
      the context.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the introductory recitative is a masterpiece of telling expression,
      and in the air itself the noble beauty of the different motifs is tinged
      with a sadness amounting to gloom, but so sublime as to inspire the same
      emotions with which we gaze at the Niobe. The ensembles with which the
      opera is provided are only in part of any dramatic significance, and where
      this is wanting the musical interest also suffers; the duets especially
      are not important either in length or <span class="side">LABOUR AND
      POVERTY.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p298.png">[298]</a></span>
      substance. Passing over the duettino (3) between Sextus and Annius, which
      became popular owing to its easy and pleasing tone, but which in no way
      corresponds to the character of an heroic opera, we may notice the first
      duet between Sextus and Vitellia as better defined, especially in the
      first movement; although even here the wish to attract is very apparent,
      and gains quite the upper hand in the triplet passages and easy imitations
      of the allegro. An expression of tender feeling is more appropriate to the
      short duet between Annius and Servilia, and the loveliness of the music
      makes up for the absence of tragic seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three terzets are better placed, and more suitable to their dramatic
      situations, but even they fail to elicit dramatic contrasts by giving to
      each character an equal and characteristic share in the piece. Thus, in
      the first terzet, Vitellia alone is inspired with lively emotion, Annius
      and Publius being mere passive spectators. It is at the moment When she
      has dispatched Sextus to the murder of Titus that she is informed of the
      Emperor's choice of her as his consort; in vain she strives to recall
      Sextus, she feels that she herself is the destroyer of her happiness. An
      agitated violin passage, with rapid changes of harmony intensified by
      suspensions, expresses the excitement and consternation to which she gives
      vent in detached and broken exclamations; but the calm observation of the
      two others&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ah, come un gran contento,
     Come confonde un cor!&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      chills the expression of Vitellia's emotion, so that the combination of
      the voices, instead of producing a climax as it ought, weakens the passion
      of the movement and prevents its rising to more than a momentary
      prominence. The second terzet (14) was suggested by an air of Metastasio,
      "Se mai senti spirarti sul volto," which was a favourite subject with the
      old composers.<a href="#linknote42-55" name="linknoteref42-55"
      id="linknoteref42-55"> 55 </a> It begins with the tender <span class="side">TITUS&mdash;ENSEMBLES.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p299.png">[299]</a></span>
      farewell of Sextus to Vitellia, stricken with shame and dismay. This
      contrast would have made an excellent opportunity for musical effect if
      Publius had supplied the connecting link by the addition of a new and
      important element in the situation; instead of this, he remains a mere
      passive spectator, and does not increase the pathos of the situation at
      all. Sextus gives the tone here, as Vitellia in the previous terzet, and
      the tender softness of his farewell scarcely allows expression to the true
      significance of the situation; otherwise, however, this terzet is superior
      to the first in the freer development of the voice parts.'" The third
      terzet (18) has a beautiful and expressive first movement, but its second
      movement is too slight in design and too little worked out for its
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opera contains one movement, however, altogether worthy of Mozart, and
      this is the first finale. It is true that even this is far from possessing
      the greatness of design or the wealth of elaboration of the finales of the
      earlier operas; it does not pretend to be more than a representation of
      the situation; but it is earnest and weighty in tone, and possesses
      features of unsurpassed loveliness. The finale is introduced by a
      soliloquy for Sextus, in which he pours out the doubt and self-reproach
      which torture his mind; an unaccompanied recitative expresses this
      condition with an amount of truth and energy elsewhere entirely wanting to
      the part of Sextus. When he sees the capitol in flames, and is convinced
      that his repentance comes too late, he becomes more collected, and the
      quintet begins with his finely expressed wish to save Titus or to die with
      him; then he has to evade the questions of Annius, who hurries in full of
      sympathy&mdash;Servilia, Publius, and Vitellia enter in quick succession,
      full of anxiety and horror; a characteristic orchestral motif gives the
      clue to the development of the movement, and the separate exclamations of
      the invisible chorus interposed in rising, dissonant chords, form the
      pivots on which the progressive harmonies turn; the re-entry of Sextus
      brings the symmetrically constructed movement to a close. A short
      recitative, in which Sextus announces the assassination of Titus, leads
      into the andante, which ends <span class="side">LABOUR AND POVERTY.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p300.png">[300]</a></span> the
      finale. All present are united in one feeling of sorrow and horror at the
      crime which has been committed, and the chorus has approached near enough
      to join in lamentation with the solo voices; the impression thus produced
      is dignified and beautiful in the extreme. Here we may perceive to what a
      height opera seria was capable of rising by a liberal development of its
      original elements; but unfortunately this movement is the only one of the
      kind in "Titus." A backward glance of comparison upon "Idomeneo"<a
      href="#linknote42-56" name="linknoteref42-56" id="linknoteref42-56"> 56
      </a> results to the advantage of the earlier opera in many and important
      points. It is true that the conventional forms of the opera seria are
      there more strictly preserved, but a fresh vigorous effort is at the same
      time made to give them meaning and substance, and pass their narrow bounds
      wherever possible,. while in "Titus" the composer has been content to
      compromise the matter by preserving the semblance of form, but no more.
      Thus forms intended to be largely treated, such as the division into two
      movements, are often so lightly and vaguely treated as to lose all
      dramatic interest, and still more marked is the tendency of the tragic and
      serious conception of the opera to degenerate into mere pleasing
      gracefulness. The advantages of the later work in a freer and easier flow
      of melody, in a more mature and cultivated taste, were more than
      counterbalanced by the loss of depth and force of musical construction, a
      loss which is all the more perceptible from the grandeur of the background
      afforded by a subject taken from the Roman imperial age, which even in
      Metas-tasio's adaptation was not wholly obscured, and under happier
      circumstances would have sufficed to inspire Mozart to a nobler creation.
      The treatment of the orchestra is indicative of the whole tone of the
      opera, displaying occasionally the full splendour with which Mozart has
      endowed it, and raising and supporting the musical representation wherever
      it attains to dramatic significance, but for the most part not going
      beyond an easy accompaniment of the voices.

      <span class="side">CRITICISMS ON "TITUS."</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p301.png">[301]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In brilliancy and delicacy of orchestral treatment "Titus" can sustain no
      comparison with "Idomeneo," or even with "Cosi fan Tutte."
    </p>
    <p>
      Opinions on this opera were widely diverse. According to Niemetschek (p.
      111) "Titus" ranks from an aesthetic and artistic point of view as
      Mozart's most perfect work:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart mentally grasped the simplicity, the quiet dignity of the character
      of Titus and of the whole plot, and embodied them in his composition.
      Every part, even the very moderate instrumental parts, bear this stamp,
      and combine into perfect unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is of opinion that full maturity of taste is nowhere more finely
      displayed than in this opera (p. 105), which is also the best example of
      Mozart's admirable dramatic characterisation (p. 72). An article showing
      the shortcomings of Metastasio's libretto praises the excellence of the
      musical characterisation which endows Titus with the character of gentle
      amiability, Vitellia with force and dignified purity, and the friendship
      between Sextus and Annius with quite an ideal tenderness.<a
      href="#linknote42-57" name="linknoteref42-57" id="linknoteref42-57"> 57
      </a> Schaul, on the contrary (Brief üb. d. Gesch-mack, p. 59), maintains
      that with the exception of a few pieces the opera is so dry and tiresome
      that it might rather be taken for the first attempt of budding talent than
      for the product of a mature mind. He quotes the criticism of an Italian,
      considered one of the best judges in Naples, that flashes of genius shone
      out here and there in the more serious airs, which showed what Mozart
      would have been capable of under happier guidance. "Titus" was criticised
      in Berlin, in 1796, with the greatest harshness and severity in two
      articles which excited indignation on account of their disrespectful tone,
      although the blame bestowed was not without foundation.<a
      href="#linknote42-58" name="linknoteref42-58" id="linknoteref42-58"> 58
      </a> With a juster regard to circumstances Rochlitz says:<a
      href="#linknote42-59" name="linknoteref42-59" id="linknoteref42-59"> 59

      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p302.png">[302]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Being only human, he was constrained either to produce an altogether
      mediocre work, or one of which the principal movements were very good, and
      the minor ones light and easy, and suited to the taste of the multitude;
      with right judgment he chose the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps this accommodation of the music to the taste of the public,
      and the concessions made to the popular love of gorgeous scenery and
      spectacular effects, which gained for "Titus" an enduring place on the
      German stage, although it was never received with the same favour as "Don
      Giovanni," "Figaro," and the "Zauberflöte." The opera was produced for the
      first time in London in 1806 for the benefit of Madame Billington, being
      the first of Mozart's operas performed in England;<a href="#linknote42-60"

      DISAPPOINTED and suffering, Mozart returned to Vienna in the middle of
      September. While his wife again repaired to Baden, he divided his time
      between the labours involved in the completion and scenic arrangements of
      the "Zauberflöte" (620 K.) and the Requiem. The chorus "O Isis und
      Osiris," Papageno's song, which Schikaneder had stipulated for, and the
      second finale, must have been written after September 12;<a
      href="#linknote43-1" name="linknoteref43-1" id="linknoteref43-1"> 1 </a>
      on September 28 he completed the overture and the march which formed the
      introduction to the second act. After many rehearsals under the
      conductorship of the Kapellmeister Henneberg, then still a very <span

      href="pgimages/p303.png">[303]</a></span> young man, the first performance
      took place on September 30. Mozart conducted at the piano, and Süssmayr
      turned over for him. The playbill ran as follows:<a href="#linknote43-2"

      This day, Friday, September 30, 1791, the Company of the Imperial Theatre
      auf der Wieden have the honour of performing for the first time Die
      Zauberflöte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grand Opera in Two Acts, by Emanuel Schikaneder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music is by Herr Wolfgang Amade Mozart, Capellmeister and Imperial
      Chamber Composer. Esteem for an appreciative public and friendship for the
      author of the work have induced Herr Mozart to consent on this occasion to
      conduct the orchestra in person.<a href="#linknote43-3"
      name="linknoteref43-3" id="linknoteref43-3"> 3 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Books of the opera, with two copper-plate engravings, representing Herr
      Schikaneder in his actual costume as Papageno, may be had at the
      box-office, price thirty kreutzers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scenery and stage accessories have been intrusted to Herr Gayl and
      Herr Nessthaler, who flatter themselves that they have performed their
      task with all due regard to the artistic requirements of the piece. <span
      class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p304.png">[304]</a></span> The success was not at first so
      great as had been expected, and after the first act Mozart rushed, pale
      and excited, behind the scenes to Schikaneder, who endeavoured to console
      him. In the course of the second act the audience recovered from the first
      shock of surprise, and at the close of the opera Mozart was recalled. He
      had hidden himself, and when he was found could with difficulty be
      persuaded to appear before the audience, not certainly from bashfulness,
      for he was used by this time to brilliant successes, but because he was
      not satisfied with the way in which his music had been received. The story
      that Haydn consoled Mozart by his approbation is untrue,<a
      href="#linknote43-4" name="linknoteref43-4" id="linknoteref43-4"> 4 </a>
      for he was in London at the time. But Schenck relates in his manuscript
      autobiography that he had a place in the orchestra at the first
      performance, and that after the overture, unable to contain his delight,
      he crept along to the conductor's stool, seized Mozart's hand and kissed
      it; Mozart, still beating time with his right hand, looked at him with a
      smile, and stroked his cheek. At the second performance on the following
      day he again conducted, but afterwards resigned the conductorship to
      Henneberg. On October 9 notice was sent to Berlin:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The new spectacular drama, "Die Zauberflöte," with music by our
      kapellmeister, Mozart, has been performed at great expense and with much
      magnificence of scenery, &amp;c.; but it has not attained the success
      hoped for, owing to the inferiority of the subject and diction of the
      piece.<a href="#linknote43-5" name="linknoteref43-5" id="linknoteref43-5">
      5 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Schikaneder, however, persevered, and with every repetition the applause
      increased; Mozart's pleasure thereat, and more especially at the
      approbation expressed by Salieri and Cavalieri, may be gathered from his
      letters to his wife. The "Zauberflöte" soon became the most popular of
      operas. It was performed twenty-four times in October; on November 23,
      1792, Schikaneder announced the hundredth, and on October 22,1795, the two
      hundredth performance of the opera.<a href="#linknote43-6"

    <p>
      Schikaneder<a href="#linknote43-7" name="linknoteref43-7"
      id="linknoteref43-7"> 7 </a> had long varied his favourite farcical pieces
      by the production of operas, either adaptations of earlier ones or works
      expressly composed for him,<a href="#linknote43-8" name="linknoteref43-8"
      id="linknoteref43-8"> 8 </a> and in 1791 he had achieved a great success
      with the romantic-comic opera "Oberon, König der Elfen," adapted by
      Gieseke from Wieland, and composed by Wranitzky (1756-1808).<a
      href="#linknote43-9" name="linknoteref43-9" id="linknoteref43-9"> 9 </a>
      The brilliant appointments of scenery, costume, and machinery, and the
      satisfaction with which the dramatisation of Wie-land's universally
      popular poem was viewed by the public, heightened the interest in the
      opera to a degree far beyond the deserts of the light and popular music.
      It was first performed in Frankfort during the coronation festivities in
      1790, and, rapidly spreading over the whole German stage, shared, and for
      a short time rivalled, the popularity of the "Zauberflöte."<a
      href="#linknote43-10" name="linknoteref43-10" id="linknoteref43-10"> 10
      </a> In order to assure himself of a repetition of this success,
      Schikaneder selected as a subject for his new opera the tale of Lulu, oder
      die Zauberflöte, from Wieland's Dschinnistan.<a href="#linknote43-11"
      name="linknoteref43-11" id="linknoteref43-11"> 11 </a> The story is
      briefly as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the kingdom of Chorassan there dwelt in an old magician's castle the
      good fairy Perifirime, called the "radiant fairy." Hunting in the
      neighbourhood, Prince Lulu, son of the King of Chorassan, enters the
      usually avoided castle, and the fairy, appearing to him in her full
      radiance, promises him rich reward if he will obey her behests. She
      discloses to him that the wicked magician Dilsenghuin, with the help of
      her faithless <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p306.png">[306]</a></span> attendant
      Barsine, has deprived her of her precious talisman, a golden fire-steel,
      which is obeyed by the spirits of the elements and of all earthly regions,
      every spark struck from it becoming a powerful spirit, subject to the
      possessor; none but a youth whose heart is as yet untouched by love can
      regain the talisman for her by stratagem. She designates Lulu as her
      deliverer, and promises him the best gift that she has if he will
      undertake the task. This is none other than the beautiful Sidi, daughter
      of Perifirime and Sabalem, King of Cashmere, whom the magician keeps in
      his power, making tender advances to her which she is only able to resist
      owing to her magic power of repelling attacks so long as her heart is
      untouched by love. The fairy dispatches Lulu with two magic gifts&mdash;a
      flute which has the power of winning all hearts, and of exciting and
      appeasing every passion at will; and a ring, by turning which the wearer
      can assume any form, and by throwing it away can summon the fairy herself
      to his aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus provided, Lulu approaches the magician's stronghold in the form of an
      old man, and by his flute-playing entices first the forest beasts, and
      then the magician, who takes him into the fortress to try his art upon the
      obdurate beauty. Lulu gains the confidence of the magician and his son,
      with Barsine and the dwarf Barka; the love of the beautiful Sidi is also
      soon his. He succeeds in throwing the magician and his companions into a
      deep sleep during a banquet, and possesses himself of the talisman. By the
      aid of the genü now subject to him, and finally by the appearance of the
      fairy, he overcomes all the dangers and obstacles prepared for him by the
      magician, who is finally changed into an owi, and flies away with his son,
      similarly transformed. The fairy destroys the fortress and carries the
      lovers to her castle upon her cloud-chariot; there the Kings of Chorassan
      and Cashmere bless their union.<a href="#linknote43-12"
      name="linknoteref43-12" id="linknoteref43-12"> 12 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This story was treated as follows in Schikaneder's opera:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Japanese" Prince, Tamino, while hunting, is pursued by a great
      serpent, and falls in a swoon; three ladies of the Queen of Night slay the
      monster.. On the awaking of the Prince there enters the bird-catcher
      Papageno, the comic character of the opera, contrasting in the traditional
      manner with the grave heroic lover (who does not, however, display any
      great daring here). Papageno is a good-tempered, pleasure-loving,
      loquacious poltroon, whose feather costume is a sort of reminiscence of
      Schikaneder's bird comedies. He gives himself out to Tamino as the slayer
      of the dragon, but is punished for his boasting by the veiled ladies, who
      reappear and fasten up his mouth with a padlock, at the same time
      presenting the Prince with the portrait of a beautiful damsel, of whom he
      instantly becomes deeply enamoured. Hearing that the original of the
      portrait is Pamina, daughter of the Queen of <span class="side">THE
      LIBRETTO-RIVAL THEATRES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p307.png">[307]</a></span> Night, and that she has been
      carried away by a wicked demon, he swears to free her from the power of
      the enemy, whereupon the Queen herself appears and promises him the hand
      of her daughter as the reward of his success. The ladies then command
      Papageno, from whose mouth they remove the padlock, to accompany Tamino to
      the castle of the magician Sarastro, which he is reluctantly obliged to
      do. They provide Tamino with a magic flute, Papageno with a chime of
      bells, and promise that "three boys, young, beautiful, pure, and wise,"
      shall hover round them as guides.<a href="#linknote43-13"
      name="linknoteref43-13" id="linknoteref43-13"> 13 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sarastro's castle Pamina, who has endeavoured by flight to escape the
      hated advances of her jailer and tormentor, the Moor Monostatos, has been
      recaptured and is kept in bondage. Papageno makes good his entry; he and
      the Moor are mutually alarmed at each other's appearance, and run away in
      opposite directions. Papageno, venturing in again, finds Pamina alone, and
      acquainting her with Prince Tamino's commission from her mother to
      liberate her, they hasten to seek for him together.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far the original story has been followed in its essential parts. The
      modifications which have been made in the characters and situations to
      enhance the dramatic interest are such as would occur naturally in the
      development of the story. But when Schikaneder had proceeded thus far in
      his adaptation he learnt that an opera founded on the same story was
      finished and about to be produced at the Leopold-stàdter Theatre, which
      often placed itself in competition with his.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in 1781 that Marinelli opened his newly erected theatre in the
      Leopoldstadt.<a href="#linknote43-14" name="linknoteref43-14"
      id="linknoteref43-14"> 14 </a> He produced operas, among which the
      "Sonnenfest der Braminen" had a great run, and after the brief span of
      popularity which German opera had enjoyed at the National Theatre, the
      suburban theatre became a formidable and finally a successful rival. But
      the proper element of this theatre was in popular farces. The comic actor
      Laroche had created the part of Kasperl, the direct descendant of
      Hanswurst, and the people were never tired of seeing him play his coarse
      tricks and antics in the most widely different situations. It had been the
      custom to bring Hanswurst into contact with witches and magicians, <span
      class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p308.png">[308]</a></span> and Kasperl was consequently
      introduced to the same society, with some differences in colouring, due to
      French taste and to the Eastern fairy tales disseminated mainly by
      Wieland. Popular songs played their part in these "Kasperliads," and out
      of modest vaudevilles, such as "Kasperl's Ehrentag," a fairy tale by
      Hensler (1789), in which the music was confined to some short choruses and
      an accompaniment to the supernatural apparitions, arose gradually comic
      magic operas. The Leopoldstàdter Theatre had possessed since 1786 a
      fruitful composer in Wenzel Müller,<a href="#linknote43-15"
      name="linknoteref43-15" id="linknoteref43-15"> 15 </a> whose place as a
      comic popular musician was somewhat similar to that of Laroche as an
      actor. On May 3, 1791, "Kasper der Vogelkràmer," by Hensler, was performed
      with his music, followed on June 8 by "Kasper der Fagottist, oder die
      Zauberzither," a vaudeville in three acts, the words adapted from "Lulu"
      by Joach. Permet.<a href="#linknote43-16" name="linknoteref43-16"
      id="linknoteref43-16"> 16 </a> The piece follows the plot of the original
      pretty closely, and the dialogue is as far as possible verbally
      transcribed; nevertheless the whole effect is that of a travesty, and the
      text of the "Zauberflöte" displays a decided superiority in comparison
      with it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Armidoro, attended by Kaspar Bita, loses himself in the chase, and
      comes upon the fairy Perifirime, who despatches them to the magician
      Bosphoro, bestowing on the prince a guitar with the same virtues as the
      magic flute, and on Kaspar (through the little sprite Pizichi, who
      frequently reappears in time of need) a magic bassoon, which gives
      occasion to some very questionable pleasantry. The magic power of the
      ring, which enables the Prince to assume at will the form of an old man or
      of a youth, is very naively employed, the fancy of the audience being
      alone called in to represent the metamorphosis. The magician has a
      swaggering boon companion, Zumio, who guards the damsels and is in love
      with Palmire, playmate of the beautiful Sidi, afterwards in a similar
      relation with Kaspar. Having conciliated Bosphoro and Zumio by means of
      their magic instruments, and gained entrance into the castle, they win the
      love of the damsels, but not without exciting the mistrust and jealousy of
      the magician and his companion, who seek to possess themselves of the
      instruments. They are saved by Perifirime from a storm raised by the
      spirits subject to Bosphoro; an attempt to poison them fails through
      Pizichi's warning; finally they are all put to sleep at <span class="side">KASPAR
      DER FAGOTTIST.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p309.png">[309]</a></span>
      supper by the magic instruments, and Armidoro possesses himself of the
      talisman which makes the spirits subject to him. Perifirime appears,
      punishes Bosphoro, and carries the lovers back to her palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from Kaspar's broad jokes, the opera is not wanting in effective
      situations, both dramatic and comic, and now and then the music takes a
      more ambitious flight. Thus, the opera opens with a grand hunting chorus,
      and the first act closes with the sprites tormenting the followers of the
      Prince, who are in search of him; the spinning song, the boat scene with
      the storm, and the sprites playing at ball with Zumio, all form good
      musical situations. The composer rises above the level of the librettist.
      In some of the songs and dances he has caught the popular tone very well,
      but has failed in the fresh humour which he elsewhere displays. In spite
      of all defects, or rather in great measure because of them, the opera, the
      music, and the <i>mise en scène</i> completely hit the popular taste, and
      125 representations took place in the course of a very few years. As a
      consequence of this success there appeared in 1792 "Pizichi," or the
      continuation of "Kaspar der Fagottist," by Perinet and Wenzel Müller,
      which had an equally brilliant reception, and was dedicated by the author
      "To the illustrious public, as a token of gratitude." Schikaneder could
      not hope to rival such a success as this with an opera on the same
      subject. He resolved therefore to transform the piece as much as possible,
      while utilising what had already been done on it, and to turn the wicked
      magician into a noble philosopher who wins Tamino to be his disciple,
      guides him to higher wisdom and virtue, and rewards him with the hand of
      Pamina. The idea was capable also of being turned to account in the
      interests of Freemasonry. The change in the political views of the
      government under Leopold II. had been unfavourable to Freemasonry, which
      began to be regarded with much distrust as the organ of political and
      religious liberalism. A glorification of the order upon the stage, by a
      performance which would place its symbolical ceremonies in a favourable
      light and justify its moral tendency, would be sure to be well received as
      a liberal party demonstration compromising neither the order as a body nor
      <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p310.png">[310]</a></span> its individual members. The
      effect was heightened by the consciousness of a secret understanding among
      the initiated, while the uninitiated could not fail to suspect a deeper
      meaning behind the brilliant display of spectacular effects.<a
      href="#linknote43-17" name="linknoteref43-17" id="linknoteref43-17"> 17
      </a> Whether Schikaneder, himself a Freemason,<a href="#linknote43-18"
      name="linknoteref43-18" id="linknoteref43-18"> 18 </a> was the author of
      this idea, or whether it was suggested by the order, we have no means of
      ascertaining; the execution of it was principally due to Joh. Georg Karl
      Ludw. Gieseke. He was born in Braunschweig, studied at the university of
      Halle, and joined Schikaneder's troupe to earn his living as an actor and
      a chorus-singer. He had tried his hand already as an author, having
      prepared the text for Wranitzky's "Oberon," and enriched Schikaneder's
      repertory with a number of pieces in part translated and in part original.
      Schikaneder, never averse to accepting foreign aid,<a href="#linknote43-19"
      name="linknoteref43-19" id="linknoteref43-19"> 19 </a> made use of
      Gieseke's labours as a groundwork, which he altered to suit his purpose,
      inserting, for instance, the characters of Papageno and Papagena, and
      giving himself out as the sole author of the piece.<a href="#linknote43-20"
      name="linknoteref43-20" id="linknoteref43-20"> 20 </a> We have no means of
      ascertaining how far this alteration in the plan of the opera affected the
      first part; points here and there may have been retouched, but no
      important corrections were made, or some very striking contradictions
      would certainly have been removed. With the first finale we find ourselves
      in an altogether new new world:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The three boys lead Tamino into a thicket, where stands the temple of
      wisdom, knowledge, and nature, exhort him to be steadfast, enduring, and
      silent, and leave him alone. He learns from a priest that Sarastro reigns
      in the temple of wisdom, and that Pamina has been taken from <span
      class="side">THE LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p311.png">[311]</a></span> her mother for certain good
      reasons, which must remain concealed from him until all shall be revealed&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Sobald dich fuhrt der
     Freundschaft Hand
     Ins Heilightum zum ew' gen Band."
</pre>
    <p>
      After being encouraged by invisible voices, and assured that Pamina still
      lives, he joyfully seizes his magic flute, whose tones have power to draw
      all living beings to him. At Papageno's signal he hastens in search of
      him. Papageno enters with Pamina; they are surprised by Monostatos and his
      slaves; Papageno has recourse to his bells, which set all who hear them
      singing and dancing. Scarcely are they free from the intruders when
      Sarastro is heard returning from the chase in his chariot drawn by six
      lions, and accompanied by a solemn march and chorus. Pamina, kneeling,
      informs him that she seeks to escape the love advances of the Moor, and
      implores him to allow her to return to her mother; this Sarastro refuses,
      but pardons her with the aphorism:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Ein Mann muss eure Herzen leiten,
     Denn ohne ihn pflegt jedes
     Weib Aus ihrem Wirkungskreis zu schreiten."
</pre>
    <p>
      In the meantime Monostatos enters, having captured Tamino; as soon as the
      latter perceives Pamina, he rushes to her, and they embrace tenderly. The
      Moor, to his consternation, is rewarded by Sarastro with "seventy-seven
      strokes of the bastinado," and the strangers are conducted into the temple
      of expiation, that their heads may be covered and they may be purified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we may still trace the original design, for the magic instruments,
      the wicked Moor, and the chariot drawn by lions, have little affinity with
      the temple of wisdom; but with the second act we set forth on altogether
      fresh ground:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the assembly of the eighteen (3x6) attendants dedicated to the great
      gods Isis and Osiris,<a href="#linknote43-21" name="linknoteref43-21"
      id="linknoteref43-21"> 21 </a> Sarastro announces that the virtuous Prince
      Tamino stands at the gate of the temple, seeking permission to gaze on the
      "great lights" of the sanctuary; questioned by the devotees, he assures
      them of the Prince's virtue, discretion, and benevolence; and, on the
      assembly giving their consent with a thrice-repeated blast of trumpets, he
      thanks them with emotion in the name of humanity. For, <span class="side">DIE
      ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p312.png">[312]</a></span>
      when Tamino, united with Pamina, shall become one of the devotees of
      wisdom, he will destroy the empire of the Queen of Night,<a
      href="#linknote43-22" name="linknoteref43-22" id="linknoteref43-22"> 22
      </a> who by superstition and imposture seeks to undermine their power; and
      virtue shall triumph at the overthrow of vice. The Orator warns him of the
      severity of the probation that he must pass through&mdash;but he is a
      prince, "nay more, he is a man"; he is able to endure all, "and once
      devoted to Osiris and Isis, he will feel the joys of the gods sooner than
      we." Tamino and Papageno are to be led into the antechamber of the temple,
      and there the Orator, in virtue of his "holy office" as "dispenser of
      wisdom," shall acquaint them both with the duty of man and the power of
      the gods. A solemn appeal to Isis and Osiris to endow the pair with
      wisdom, and to strengthen and protect them in the hour of trial closes
      this scene, which bears the impress of Freemasonry throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tests begin, after Tamino has declared that, impelled by love, he is
      ready for any trial to acquire wisdom and gain Pamina, and Papageno has
      agreed to make the attempt to win the love of Papagena, a pretty little
      woman, just suited to him. The impression here intended to be conveyed is
      evidently that of the higher nature and strivings of man in Tamino and of
      the limited and purely sensual side of his nature in Papageno. The first
      trial is that of silence. They are scarcely left alone in the darkness
      when the three Jadies of the Queen of Night enter and strive to excite
      their terrors, which is easily accomplished as far as Papageno is
      concerned, the steadfast Tamino with difficulty restraining his cries. The
      ladies disappear upon the summons of the priest; the Orator praises
      Tamino, and again covers his head that he may continue his "pilgrimage."
      Monostatos finds Pamina asleep in the garden, and is on the point of
      kissing her, when the Queen of Night appears, gives Pamina a dagger, and
      commands her to avenge her wrongs on Sarastro, to whom Pamina's father had
      bequeathed the omnipotent talisman which she had hoped to possess; by
      Sarastro's death Pamina will gain her freedom, Tamino's life, and her
      mother's love. Monostatos, who has overheard, takes the dagger from
      Pamina, and threatens to betray her unless she will grant him her love; on
      her refusal, he tries to kill her, when Sarastro enters, liberates Pamina,
      and promises to wreak a noble vengeance on her mother by securing her
      daughter's happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tamino and Papageno are conducted into a hall, to remain there in <span
      class="side">THE LIBRETTO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p313.png">[313]</a></span> silence until they hear a
      trumpet sound. Papageno cannot refrain from chattering to an old woman who
      brings him a glass of water and, to his horror, claims him as her lover; a
      fearful thunder-clap terrifies him, and he only recovers when the three
      boys bring him a richly furnished table, and, reiterating the warning to
      silence, restore the magic instruments. While they are eating, Pamina
      enters, and construes Tamino's silence into a proof of his want of love
      for her; not even her lamentations, however, can tempt him to speak. After
      this proof of steadfastness, he is conducted to the assembly, and informed
      by Sarastro that two paths of danger still remain to be trodden; Pamina is
      brought in to bid him farewell, and, to her despair, he still refuses to
      utter a word to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papageno is informed by the Orator that he shall be excused the punishment
      for his loquacity, but that he is never to feel "the divine joys of the
      initiated." He declares himself quite content, and only wishes for a cup
      of wine and "ein Mädchen oder Weibchen"; the old woman appears, and is
      changed into the youthful Papagena, but only to vanish again the same
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pamina, plunged in deep melancholy by Tamino's apparent aversion, is on
      the point of stabbing herself, but is restrained by the three boys, who
      promise to restore Tamino to her. Tamino is just then conducted to the
      gates of horror by two men in armour, with the injunction&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Der welcher wandelt diese Strasse voll Beschwerden,
     Wird rein durch Wasser, Feuer, Luft und Erden;
     Wenn er des Todes Schrecken überwinden kann,
     Schwingt er sich aus der Erde himmelan.
     Erleuchtet wird er dann im Stande sein,
     Sich den Mysterien der Isis ganz zu weihn"&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      and left to tread the path of danger through fire and water, when Pamina
      rushes in, resolved to endure this trial in company with him. They sustain
      it happily to the sound of the magic flute, and are received with solemn
      rejoicings by the assembly in the temple. Papageno, in despair at the loss
      of his Papagena, whom he calls in vain to return, is about to hang
      himself, when the three boys appear, and remind him of his bells: at the
      sound of them Papagena returns, and his happiness is complete. In the
      meantime the Queen of Night, with her ladies, has gained admittance into
      the sanctuary by the help of Monostatos, and promises him her daughter's
      hand, if he aids her to victory; but a fearful storm drives them back, and
      Tamino and Pamina are united with priestly pomp by Sarastro in the circle
      of the temple votaries:&mdash;

      It would be superfluous to criticise this libretto. The small interest of
      the plot, the contradictions and improbabilities in the characters and in
      the situations, are clear <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p314.png">[314]</a></span> to all; the
      dialogue is trivial, and the versified portions wretched doggerel,
      incapable of improvement by mere alteration. Nevertheless, a certain
      amount of stage dexterity is not to be denied to it. Schikaneder knew how
      to excite and sustain the interest of his audience by theatrical effects
      of combination and alteration. On this point the testimony of Goethe<a
      href="#linknote43-23" name="linknoteref43-23" id="linknoteref43-23"> 23
      </a> is added to the lasting and wide-spread approval of the public; he
      declares that the "Zauberflöte" is "full of improbabilities and of jokes
      that it is not easy to appreciate or to enjoy; but it must be allowed that
      the author has thoroughly grasped the idea of contrast and of producing
      grand theatrical effects"; he undertook a translation of the piece, and
      was for some time seriously occupied with it.<a href="#linknote43-24"
      name="linknoteref43-24" id="linknoteref43-24"> 24 </a> Undeniable as it is
      that the opera owes to Mozart's music the charm that it exercises over
      young and old, cultivated and uncultivated, it must be acknowledged that
      the piece,<a href="#linknote43-25" name="linknoteref43-25"
      id="linknoteref43-25"> 25 </a> poor from a dramatic point of view, affords
      many and good opportunities for the production of musical effects.<a

      </a> Whether <span class="side">THE OVERTURE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p315.png">[315]</a></span> we think much or little of the
      Masonic views which are here seen embodied in the mysteries of Isis,<a
      href="#linknote43-27" name="linknoteref43-27" id="linknoteref43-27"> 27
      </a> Mozart at any rate was inspired by the zeal of a partisan in giving
      them utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dignity and grandeur with which the music reveals the symbolism of
      these mysteries certainly have their root in his intense devotion to the
      Masonic idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear indication of this devotion was given to the initiated in the
      overture,<a href="#linknote43-28" name="linknoteref43-28"
      id="linknoteref43-28"> 28 </a> but in a way that showed how well he
      distinguished Masonic symbolism from artistic impulse. It opens with a
      short adagio, whose solemn accents raise the expectation of an apparition
      of grave importance, The trumpets, which are added to the full choir of
      wind instruments, give a fulness and brilliancy to the chords which had
      not at that time been heard before. The allegro; begins with a regular
      fugue on the theme&mdash;[See Page Image] the first bars reminding us of
      dementi's sonata, played before the Emperor Joseph (Vol. II., p. 199):&mdash;

      <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p316.png">[316]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the first glance at the subject of an overture to J. H. Collo's
      cantata, "Lazarus Auferstehung" (Leipzig, 1779)&mdash;[See Page Image]
      shows a considerable similarity to the motif of the overture before us,<a
      href="#linknote43-29" name="linknoteref43-29" id="linknoteref43-29"> 29
      </a> with which it cannot have had anything to do, since Mozart in all
      probability never knew the cantata.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the regular fourth entry of the whole motif, a free fantasia begins
      with the separate parts of it and the counter motif, in the most varied
      shades of expression, with an ease and elegance which lets nothing appear
      of the technicalities of counterpoint, and displays an animation and
      liveliness of truly sparkling brilliancy. After the close of the movement
      on the dominant with a marvellous crescendo, there follow three chords
      three times repeated, with pauses between, given out by the wind
      instruments alone, with powerful effect of climax:<a href="#linknote43-30"

      They are the same that occur in the temple assembly as a sign that Tamino
      is accepted and appointed to undergo the itests, and were suggested by the
      knocking or other rhythmical sounds to which members were admitted to be
      initiated in the mysteries of the Masonic lodge. This does away with the
      frequent suggestion that the second and third chords are <span class="side">THE
      OVERTURE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p317.png">[317]</a></span>
      intended to baboimd,<a href="#linknote43-31" name="linknoteref43-31"
      id="linknoteref43-31"> 31 </a> indeed André declares in the preface! to
      his edition that this solemn introduction, "uncomprehended of a profane
      public," to the mystic work which follows would be quite spoilt by the
      binding of these chords! Winter has accentuated the rhythm still more
      sharply in the "Labyrinth," the second part of the "Zauberflöte," the
      overture of which begins with the chords&mdash;[See Page Image] which are
      repeated several times. The chords suggest to the musical mind only the
      solemn warning sound calling attention to what is to follow, but to the
      initiated they recall the probation which must be undergone by those who
      engage in the search for a higher light. In the allegro which follows the
      first theme is taken up again, not in regular fugal form, but working out
      the different motifs with unusually elaborate contrapuntal treatment, for
      the most part in the stretto. The very form of thematic treatment gives an
      impression of force, but of force opposed by many obstacles and hard to
      overcome; this is strengthened by the use of the minor key and by the
      startling harmonic progressions which intensify the character of gloom,
      until it amounts to horror. Serenity returns only with the recurrence of
      the principal key, and gradually rises to a glorious radiance, troubled
      only towards the close by a few startling chords, and shining out again
      with all the purer beauty, till one seems to float in a very sea of light.<a

      are clothed in a musical dress; the true triumph of genius consists in
      having created a work which, quite apart from <span class="side">DIE

      scholarship or hidden meaning, produces by its perfection an effect on the

      The belief that Mozart selected the severer musical forms for his overture
      in order to prefigure the serious mood in which he approached the opera,
      obtains confirmation from his employment of them again at the solemn
      moment of trial. The entrance of the men in armour, who fortify Tamino
      with the words quoted above, before he proceeds on his dangerous voyage
      through the elements, is announced by an imitative passage for the strings&mdash;[See
      Page Imge] following a few solemn introductory bars, and retained in the
      subsequent working-out as a figured accompaniment to the song of the two
      men. The Cantus firmus, however, which they sing in unison, in octave,
      supported by flutes, oboes, bassoons, and trombones, is the old chorale
      "Ach Gott vom Himmel sieh darein,"<a href="#linknote43-34"
      name="linknoteref43-34" id="linknoteref43-34"> 34 </a> unaltered except in
      the division of the crotchets into quavers, where the words <span
      class="side">ACH GOTT VOM HIMMEL.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p319.png">[319]</a></span> require it, and in the closing
      line added by Mozart.<a href="#linknote43-35" name="linknoteref43-35"
      id="linknoteref43-35"> 35 </a> He learnt the melody no doubt from
      Kirnberger, who often made use of it as an example, and twice worked it
      into a Cantus firmus.<a href="#linknote43-36" name="linknoteref43-36"
      id="linknoteref43-36"> 36 </a> This may be gathered from the fact that
      Kirnberger as well as Mozart raised the second line by a third, and that a
      motif interwoven with it by Mozart is an evident reminiscence<a
      href="#linknote43-37" name="linknoteref43-37" id="linknoteref43-37"> 37
      </a> of one employed by Kirnberger in the working out of the chorale "Es
      woll uns Gott genàdig sein":&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      The attraction which the melody had for him as a Cantus firmus for
      contrapuntal elaboration is proved by a sketch preserved in the Imperial
      Library at Vienna, which contains the beginning of another four-part
      elaboration of the theme, adhering still more closely to Kirnberger.
      According to Al. Fuchs,<a href="#linknote43-38" name="linknoteref43-38"
      id="linknoteref43-38"> 38 </a> this was the first of Mozart's drafts for
      the opera, to which it can only be said that in that case he made use of
      an earlier contrapuntal study. In the autograph score the movement is
      written continuously in connection with the whole finale, but the
      handwriting, at first neat, afterwards more and more hasty, shows clearly
      that it was copied from an earlier sketch.<a href="#linknote43-39"
      name="linknoteref43-39" id="linknoteref43-39"> 39 </a> Even those who are
      incapable of appreciating the contrapuntal art with which this movement is

      </a> will receive an impression of mystery and solemnity admirably
      expressive of the dramatic situation to which Mozart strove to give
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart has throughout the opera given to the music which touched on the
      mysteries and the initiation into them a peculiarly solemn character, and
      this is consistently maintained through every shade of feeling, from mild
      gravity to inspired ecstasy. To this sphere belong the three boys, who,
      although emissaries of the Queen of Night, are represented in the course
      of the plot as the visible genü of the secret bond. In the quintet (6) the
      announcement of the guidance they offer to Tamino and Papageno is
      accompanied by a peculiar fexpression in the music, produced by a change
      in the harmonic and rhythmic construction<a href="#linknote43-42"
      name="linknoteref43-42" id="linknoteref43-42"> 42 </a> and in the
      instrumentation. The marchlike movement to which they lead Tamino to the
      gates of the sanctuary fulfils to admiration the expectation which has
      been raised. The sound-effects also are very uncommon. The clear boys'
      voices, supported by the stringed instruments without the double-bass, are
      sustained by the full, lightly touched chords of the trombones and muted
      trumpets and drums; and a long-sustained G for the flutes and clarinets
      sheds a mild radiance like a nimbus over the whole. The thrice-repeated
      warning "Sei standhaft, duldsam und verschwiegen," taken up by the firm
      tones of the wind instruments, raises the march whose solemn course it
      interrupts to a higher dignity and force; the few bars sung by Tamino
      throw into greater prominence the unusual character of the apparition, and
      the repetition of the boys' song strengthens the impression which has been
      given of the higher world to which we now have access. Such an
      introduction as this was essential to give the right tone and <span
      class="side">TAMINO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p321.png">[321]</a></span> groundwork for the long
      recitative which follows, in which Tamino, prejudiced against Sarastro's
      wisdom and virtue, is gradually confounded and half-convinced by one of
      the priests of the temple. In liveliness of dramatic expression and
      successful rendering of the contrasts of animated conversation, combined
      with the seriousness proper to the surroundings and to the dignity of the
      priest, this recitative stands alone. The climax of the scene is reached
      in the consolatory assurance of the priest that all shall be made plain&mdash;[See
      Page Image] which is twice repeated by invisible male voices, accompanied
      by trumpet chords. A solemn expression, in which emotion and exaltation
      are united, betokens the announcement of an oracle. The requirements of
      musical climax, of dramatic effect, and of mystic symbolism are here again
      at one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile we are conducted to the temple portals; Tamino is consoled and
      reanimated by the intelligence that Pamina still lives, and, still far
      from having attained the philosophic calm of the votaries, he has no
      thought but for his love. As soon as he begins to express this purely
      personal and human emotion, the music becomes freer and lighter, and
      solemn seriousness gives place to cheerful geniality. The part taken at
      this juncture by the magic flute in assembling the listening animals round
      Tamino has no connection with the situation nor with the symbolism of the
      piece; it is a relic of the old fable. It was probably owing to Mozart's
      aversion to the flute (Vol. I., p. 385), as well as to the moderate
      proficiency of the tenor Schack, who played it himself, that the flute is
      brought so little forward as a solo instrument; another reason being that,
      as Tamino played it himself, it could only be inserted in the pauses of
      his songs. In this place it is a ballad-like cantilene to which the flute
      supplies the prelude and interlude; afterwards, during the visit to the
      dark cave, Mozart has left the flute part to the fancy of the flautist.
      During the fire and water ordeal, the flute has the melody of a slow
      march, and the peculiar accompaniment of low chords for the trombones,
      <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p322.png">[322]</a></span> horns, trumpets and drums give
      it a curious, weirdlike character.<a href="#linknote43-43"
      name="linknoteref43-43" id="linknoteref43-43"> 43 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The three boys, or genü, in accordance with the numerical symbolism
      pervading the whole, appear three times. After acting as guides to Tamino,
      they appear to him and Papageno as they wait in silence within the gloomy
      cavern, and bring them for their consolation meat and drink, as well as
      the magic flute and bells. The musical characterisation is therefore
      lighter and more cheerful. Mozart, hopeless of making anything out of the
      nonsensical words, has kept to the delineation of an attractive ethereal
      apparition, and has created a short movement of marvellous grace and charm
      (17) endowed, as it were, with wings by the lovely violin passage which
      accompanies it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third appearance is again of a solemn character. The boys announce
      that soon "superstition shall disappear and wisdom shall triumph." The
      character of the melody and rhythm approaches that of the first movement,
      the instrumentation, as befits the situation, being less brilliant,
      although the tone-colouring of the combined clarinets, horns, and bassoons
      has a significance all its own.<a href="#linknote43-44"
      name="linknoteref43-44" id="linknoteref43-44"> 44 </a> The object here is
      to restrain Pamina from suicide and to offer her consolation; thus, while
      the boys are interwoven in the plot, they stand necessarily outside of the
      narrow circle of allegorical personages, and become, as it were, human;
      besides this, the exigences of the music require that they should be
      subordinate to Pamina. In the course of this scene, therefore, they lay
      aside their proper character to some extent, and become more pliant and
      less reserved. Mozart has rightly avoided too close an adherence to any
      external characterisation of the boys, and has adopted such means of
      expression as were best suited to each situation, not forgetting, however,
      to assert their individualities at every appropriate point. Pamina, on her
      side, is brought <span class="side">CHORUSES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p323.png">[323]</a></span> into closer contact with the
      boys from the moment when she yields to their persuasions, and thus the
      ensemble with which the scene closes is endowed with a nobler, more
      exalted expression than that of the purely subjective emotion of Pamina's
      longing for her lost lover. A solemnity of a more exalted order belongs to
      those scenes in which Sarastro and the temple priests take part. This is
      at once manifest in the first finale, which has an altogether exoteric
      character. The march and chorus with which Sarastro is received, the
      closing chorus which celebrates his virtue and justice, combine force and
      dignity with a perfect radiance of beauty; they correspond to the choruses
      at the end of the opera when Tamino and Pamina, having withstood every
      ordeal, are welcomed within the temple and crowned with glory and wisdom.
      They are distinguished above the ordinary operatic choruses of the day as
      much by their dignity of expression as by their construction and mode of
      treatment; and the wealth of the instrumentation, more especially the
      introduction of the trumpets, gives a character of solemnity and
      magnificence then unknown in operatic music. Nevertheless they do not
      obtrude beyond the natural framework of the opera, and the limits of a
      work of art are never exceeded in the effort to express a higher meaning
      in the music. The analogy of the choruses with those in "König Thamos" has
      already been pointed out (Vol. II., p. 111). There they are treated very
      elaborately as independent pieces of music, while here the greater
      concentration of musical forces and the maturer, more elevated forms of
      beauty, display the mastery of a finished artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The esoteric character of the mysteries is brought to view in the second
      act. A solemn, slow march (10) introduces. the assembly of the priests in
      the most appropriate manner. It is said that in answer to the accusation
      of a friend that he had stolen this march from Gluck's "Alceste" (Act I.,
      sc. 3), Mozart laughingly replied that that was impossible, as it still
      stood there. It was perhaps the best answer to such an impertinence. The
      similarity to Gluck's march, as well as to the last march in "Idomeneo"
      (25), consists entirely in the fitting expression of closely related
      moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p324.png">[324]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But the special points in the conception are altogether new and original.
      A presageful mood, tinged with a gentle melancholy, rising to greater
      energy towards the close, transfuses this wonderful movement, the very
      tone-colouring of which is affecting. The soft muted tones of the
      basset-horn and bassoons are made clearer and purer by the addition of a
      flute, while the full chords of horns and trombones and the stringed
      instruments bind these elements into unity. The same tone-colouring, only
      several shades deeper (the flute being omitted, and of the strings only
      violas and violoncelli retained), is continued in the prayer (11) which
      follows, addressed to Isis and Osiris in a mysterious twilight, from which
      the simple impressive melody for the bass voice sounds forth with majestic
      and soothing effect. The repetition of the closing passage by the male
      chorus is of quite indescribable effect, when Sarastro's characteristic
      passage&mdash;[See Page Image] is given an octave higher. The earnest
      religious conception which underlies this prayer shows the spirit in which
      the symbols and rites of Freemasonry were approached by Mozart, who once
      thanked God that through Freemasonry he had learnt to look upon death as
      the gate of true happiness (Vol. II., p. 323).
    </p>
    <p>
      The duet for the two priests (12)&mdash;a warning against feminine malice&mdash;does
      not come up to the same high standard, and only becomes at all imposing at
      the closing bars, "Tod und Verzweiflung war sein Lohn." The words could
      not be delivered with gravity without producing too comic an effect;
      Mozart has therefore treated them as a piece of friendly counsel, not as a
      priestly admonition, The second chorus of priests (19), which greets
      Tamino at the successful issue of his first trial, has, on the other hand,
      quite the dignity and solemnity of the first; although doubt and anxiety
      are for the present at an end, there is as yet none of the jubilant
      delight with which the victor is hailed at the final victory. A character
      of purity and elevation is expressed with a manly confidence differing
      from the <span class="side">SARASTRO&mdash;AIR&mdash;TERZET.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p325.png">[325]</a></span> intense
      sympathy of the first chorus, and the instrumentation is modified
      accordingly. Trombones and horns give an imposing tone, lightened by
      trumpets, flutes and oboes, instead of basset-horns, while the prevailing
      low position of the stringed instruments supplies force and gravity to the
      movement. The moderate length of this chorus, as of all the movements
      which have the same solemn and mystic tone, is a fresh proof of Mozart's
      sure insight. The powerful impression is made, the excited mood is
      appeased, without fatiguing the mind or dulling the charm of the unusual
      characterisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarastro never descends altogether from his high priestly eminence, but he
      shows a genial side to his character, and sometimes, as on his first
      appearance in the finale, a fatherly one. This more genial nature is
      expressed in the air (16),
    </p>
    <p>
      "In diesen heiligen Hallen," which, as with so many other pieces from the
      "Zauberflöte," we have first to forget having so often heard maltreated
      before we can realise the original impression made by it. The simple
      instrumentation and the easy treatment of the cavatina shows at once that
      the priestly character is not meant to be maintained here: it is the
      paternal friend speaking words of comfort to the maiden who confides in
      him.<a href="#linknote43-45" name="linknoteref43-45" id="linknoteref43-45">
      45 </a> Mozart, convinced that Freemasonry is the key to true philanthropy
      and friendship, has not contented himself with merely setting the trivial
      words before him to music, but has given expression with all the warmth
      and intensity of his nature to the highest and noblest feelings of the
      human heart. The beautiful terzet (20) gives a peculiarly elevated calm to
      Sarastro's sympathy in a situation which is more dramatic and musical than
      almost any other in the opera. Pamina is led in to bid farewell to Tamino
      before he sets forth for his final ordeal. This in itself is a test of his
      fortitude, for he is constrained to oppose reserve to her excitement, and
      to endure her reproaches for his apparent want of tenderness in silence.
      Between them stands Sarastro, consoling and <span class="side">DIE
      ZAUBERFLöTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p326.png">[326]</a></span>
      exhorting them, like a higher power holding the fate of them both in his
      hand.<a href="#linknote43-46" name="linknoteref43-46" id="linknoteref43-46">
      46 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mozart's task to blend into one these conflicting elements of
      passionate grief, of deep emotion restrained by an inflexible will, and of
      unyielding earnest exhortation. It was comparatively easy to accentuate
      the contrasts. Pamina and Sarastro are in absolute opposition, and Tamino,
      joining issue now with one, now with the other, forms a natural middle
      point. It is fortunate, from a musical point of view, that the arrangement
      of the parts falls in with these conditions, land that the natural course
      of the emotions depicted lends itself to a musical climax. The simplicity
      of the orchestral means here made use of by Mozart shows how much he was
      able to accomplish with very little, especially in the accompaniment
      passage, which renders so marvellously the agitation of the situation.<a
      href="#linknote43-47" name="linknoteref43-47" id="linknoteref43-47"> 47
      </a> It may at first sight appear fcommonplace; but the unusually low
      position of the violas, violoncelli, and bassoons gives it a striking
      expression of power and of breathless urgency.<a href="#linknote43-48"
      name="linknoteref43-48" id="linknoteref43-48"> 48 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The part of Sarastro taxed all the resources of a deep bass voice, such as
      that for which Franz Gerl, the original supporter of the part, was
      celebrated.<a href="#linknote43-49" name="linknoteref43-49"
      id="linknoteref43-49"> 49 </a> It was in another way as original a
      conception as that of Osmin. The latter may be said to have had a
      predecessor in the buffo of the Italian opera, but Sarastro is the first
      of his kind, and can as little be compared to the regulation bass parts of
      Italian opera as Almaviva and Don Giovanni to the baritones. The dignity
      and calm of the philosopher to whom passion is unknown would have afforded
      little opportunity for musical characterisation had not Mozart's genuinely
      German nature gone down to the intellectual depths of the character. For
      <span class="side">TAMINO.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p327.png">[327]</a></span> Sarastro's good temper and
      amiability, which might so easily do violence to the idealism of the
      conception, show their German origin unaffected by the symbolism around
      them. Mozart sought and found in the powerful sonorous tones of the bass
      voice the musical organ for the expression of a nature passionless indeed,
      but open to all that is good and noble, and possessing the benevolence and
      truthfulness of a mind matured in the graver experiences of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intrusion of Masonic mysteries into the plot has had a bad effect upon
      the treatment of the characters, Tamino especially being injured by it. At
      first he scarcely presents an heroic appearance&mdash;rather that of a
      susceptible and generous youth longing to meet danger and strife that the
      right and his love may prevail. The original course of the plot leads him
      into dangers which he has to overcome by strength and courage; here, for
      some incomprehensible reason, he is to be converted to a belief in
      Sarastro. The fact of his probation taking place for the most part in
      silence is of disadvantage to him, both as a tenor and a lover; the dark
      cave and the wandering through fire and water are not particularly
      terrifying to the spectators, and his praiseworthy endeavours after virtue
      are too abstract to be interesting. And yet Mozart has filled in this
      colourless outline with the warm tints of youthful enthusiasm for all that
      is noble in life and in love. The first air (4) strikes the tone which is
      to prevail throughout. We may trust the word of the poet, that the sight
      of a lovely woman is sufficient to inspire the heart with a love that is
      irresistible, and to rouse it to a new and blissful life; but the musician
      alone has the power of so realising the miracle to the mind of the hearer
      that he feels it working in himself; and such a musician is Mozart. After
      a twice-repeated sort of sigh from the orchestra, there streams forth from
      an overflowing heart:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      More agitated feelings follow this first glad expression of love, and the
      development of strong emotion is expressed by the form of the musical
      representation which follows every <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLöTE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p328.png">[328]</a></span> turn of
      thought, breaking off the threads and joining them again without any
      connected flow of melody. The whole piece is a well-constructed cantilene,
      formed from separate symmetrical phrases, and recurring at the close with
      the words, "und ewig ware sie dann mein," to the same melody which
      followed the first exclamation with "mein Herz mit neuer Regung füllt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stormy passion and fierce longing are the proper accompaniments to all
      youthful love, and the moderation with which Tamino keeps them in check
      gives at once the keynote to his character. His enthusiasm for an ideal,
      and his noble and intelligent mind, are opened to us in the fine
      recitative, and the calmer expression of love which follows completes the
      picture of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benedict Schack, the original Tamino (b. 1758) was both musically and
      intellectually a cultivated man. He was a good flautist, and composed
      several operas for Schikaneder's company, which he joined as a vocalist in
      1784. He had become very intimate with Mozart in Vienna. When the latter
      called for him, as he often did, to take a walk, he used, while Schack was
      dressing, to seat himself at his writing-table and compose little bits of
      the opera which lay there. Schack was equally famed for his flexible and
      metallically pure tenor voice and his artistic and refined execution, but
      he.was a very inferior actor.<a href="#linknote43-50"

    </p>
    <p>
      As the piece proceeds the love intrigue takes a peculiar tone from its
      association with the mysteries and with the ordeals belonging to them.
      Many allusions are made to the dignity of marriage as the consummation of
      righteous love, and this is apparently the sense intended to be conveyed
      by the oft-quoted ludicrous doggerel:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Ihr (der Liebe) Zweck zeigt deutlich an,
     Nichts edlers sei als Weib und Mann;
     Mann und Weib, und Weib und Mann,

    <p>
      The main points, how Tamino is to win Pamina by his <span class="side">PAMINA.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p329.png">[329]</a></span>
      initiation into the mysteries, and how Pamina comes to share his ordeals
      with him, are not made clear, since the love intrigue has originally
      nothing to do with them. Pamina,<a href="#linknote43-51"
      name="linknoteref43-51" id="linknoteref43-51"> 51 </a> at first
      contrasting with Papagena only as a gay, lively young girl whose higher
      nature has had no opportunity for development, shows herself in her true
      proportions when she approaches Sarastro with the pride and
      self-possession which denote her as his equal in dignity and sentiment. It
      is but for one short moment that the lovers first see each other, and by
      an irresistible impulse rush into each other's arms. This outbreak of
      passion falls so naturally into the rest of the movement, essentially
      different as it is in tone, that one is amazed that such simple notes can
      give so powerful an impression of jubilant emotion. Tamino and Pamina are
      separated at once, and are not reunited until near the end of the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Tamino may be said to be the expression of the enthusiasm of love as it
      awakes in the bosom of youth, Pamina may, on the other hand, be considered
      as the embodiment of the torment excited in a loving heart by doubt of the
      loved one's constancy. The spark which is kindled in her bosom by the
      sight of Tamino rises into an inextinguishable flame, and when his
      obstinate silence causes her to doubt his love, every hope of joy vanishes
      from her breast. It is not a difficult task for music to render the
      anguish of a broken heart, and the keener the pangs to be conveyed the
      easier it becomes. But to express with the utmost truth and intensity the
      deep grief of a maiden who has learnt to know her own heart by the first
      mighty pulsation of love, at the very moment when her hope is to be rudely
      dashed to the ground&mdash;this is the work of such a master only as the
      composer of the air (18) "Ach ich fühls."<a href="#linknote43-52"
      name="linknoteref43-52" id="linknoteref43-52"> 52 </a> Bitter pain <span
      class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p330.png">[330]</a></span> speaks here&mdash;pain without
      hope of solace; the memory of a vanished happiness has not yet softened
      into regretful melancholy, nor is it sharpened by the lingering pangs of
      conflict and torment overcome; it is a pain as yet unconscious of its own
      force and intensity. All feelings are swallowed up in the one: "He loves
      me not, and happiness is flown!" When to this open and truthful expression
      of the anguish endured by an innocent heart is united the charm of budding
      maidenhood, we feel ourselves in the presence of a beauty which moves our
      inmost being, and which Mozart alone of all musicians is capable of
      rendering in song. The form and means of effect employed are of the
      simplest kind. The music follows the course of the emotions in a
      continuous flow, without allowing any definite motif to predominate. It is
      a very delicate touch which makes the same expressive phrase occurring in
      the major to the words, "nimmer kehrt ihr Wonnestunden meinem Herzen mehr
      zurück," recur in the minor at the close to the words, "so wird Ruh im
      Tode sein." The voice part is put very prominently forward, the stringed
      instruments maintaining the harmonies and the rhythm in the simplest
      manner, while different wind instruments (flutes, oboes, bassoons) give a
      sharper accent here and there. The orchestra becomes independent only in
      the closing symphony, expressing deep sorrow very effectively by means of
      its syncopated rhythm and chromatic passages. This air forms a decided
      contrast to the garden air in "Figaro" (Vol. III., p. 91), and yet there
      is a deep-seated relationship apparent in them. In "Figaro" we have the
      purest expression of happy love, flowing from a human heart without a
      disturbing thought. Here it is the unmingled expression of sorrow for
      departed love. The one has the soft warm glow of a fragrant summer night;
      the other is like moonlight shining on rippling waters; but in truth,
      purity, and beauty of musical rendering, the two songs unmistakably betray
      the mind and hand of one and the same musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the painful impression has had time to die away there follows the
      brief interview of the lovers in presence of Sarastro and the Initiated,
      as represented in the terzet (20).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">PAMINA&mdash;TERZET.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p331.png">[331]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pamina, in her anxiety and doubt as to whether Tamino's love will stand
      the test imposed upon it, gives the tone to the whole piece. Her concern
      is not appeased by Sarastro and Tamino's consoling assurances, and not
      until the time for farewell has really arrived do the two lovers' parts
      unite and contrast with that of Sarastro. Then the expression of emotion
      is raised and purified, and indicated by touches of extraordinary delicacy
      and depth, as when Pamina's passionate outbreak&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      deprives Tamino of self-control, and he too gives vent to the anguish of
      parting, while she appeals to him in mingled joy and sorrow, and Sarastro
      remains inexorable; or when at the inimitably beautiful passage at the
      close the hearts as well as the voices of the lovers seem to mingle and
      flow into one. Here again we may admire the skill with which the ordinary
      resources of musical representation are employed to produce extraordinary
      effects.<a href="#linknote43-53" name="linknoteref43-53"
      id="linknoteref43-53"> 53 </a> Instead of feeling her anxiety set at rest
      by this interview, Pamina is more violently agitated than before. She now
      no longer doubts that Tamino has ceased to love her, and, deprived of all
      hope, she seizes the dagger which her mother has given to her to murder
      Sarastro, and prepares to plunge it in her own bosom. Thus, at the
      beginning of the second finale, we find her "half-frantic" under the
      protection of the three boys. Their presence has a moderating effect on
      her passion of despair, and Mozart has carefully refrained from giving to
      the thoughts of suicide excited in a maiden's breast by her first
      disappointment in love the same kind of expression as would belong to one
      who, exhausted by long strife with the world, had resolved to rid himself
      of life and his sorrows <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p332.png">[332]</a></span> together.
      Thus, bold and energetic as the musical expression is, it never causes any
      distortion in the picture of a charming innocent girl, and this has a more
      tranquillising effect on the minds of the audience than the support of the
      three boys. In accordance with the situation the movement of the voices is
      quite free, generally declamatory, the interjections of the three boys
      holding the whole movement firmly in its groove. Pamina gives ready ear to
      the reassurance of the three boys, but, instead of breaking into loud
      exultation, her mind recurs lovingly to Tamino, and the music gains that
      soft pathetic tone which belongs to modern music. The supernatural element
      of the scene idealises it, and prepares the way for the solemn ordeal
      which is immediately to follow. Tamino, who has determined to tread the
      path of danger, but has believed he was to tread it alone, is agreeably
      surprised to find Pamina at his side. The reunion of the lovers is
      deprived, in face of the dangers which they are to overcome together, of
      every trace of sensual passion. Not until they are initiated into the
      mysteries for which they are undergoing probation can their love be
      justified or its enjoyment assured. The tone of the scene therefore is a
      serious one, rendered even solemn by the participation of the grave
      guardians of the sanctuary, who have just enunciated its ordinances. But
      the human emotion which irresistibly breaks forth adds a pathos to the
      solemnity and a charm to the youthful pair, filling us with renewed
      admiration for the genius which blends all these diverse elements into a
      living and harmonious whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a pair of lovers as this, so ideal, so sentimental (schwarmerisch) in
      their feelings and mode of expression, betray at once their German origin
      and character; there is nothing analogous in Mozart's Italian operas; even
      Belmont and Constanze, though of the same type, display more human
      passion. To the representatives of noble humanity, Sarastro, Tamino, and
      Pamina, stands opposed the antagonistic and vindictive principle, in the
      person of the Queen of Night. The manner of her representation leaves
      distinct traces visible of the different part she was originally intended
      to fill. At the beginning, when she appears as the <span class="side">THE
      QUEEN OF NIGHT.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p333.png">[333]</a></span>
      deeply injured mother, with all the magnificence of her regal state, there
      is nothing in the musical characterisation to indicate her gloomy and
      vindictive nature, which is thus proved to have been an afterthought. A
      solemn introduction, rising into a powerful crescendo, announces the
      coming of the Queen, while "the mountains are cleft asunder." It has been
      pointed out<a href="#linknote43-54" name="linknoteref43-54"
      id="linknoteref43-54"> 54 </a> that this ritornello has considerable
      resemblance to the passage in Benda's "Ariadne," which accompanies the
      setting of the sun:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart knew and admired Benda's "Ariadne," and this passage may have been
      in his mind; but it is scarcely to be imagined that he consciously
      imitated it, and in any case he has rendered it far more effectively. A
      short recitative is followed by an air in two movements (5), the only one
      so <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p334.png">[334]</a></span> elaborate in form of the whole
      opera, the result doubtless of the traditional conception of the character
      of the Queen. The first movement expresses a mother's grief simply and
      pathetically, but without any tinge of the supernatural to characterise
      her either as the good fairy or as the Queen of Night. The allegro is far
      weaker, going off after a few energetic bars into long runs and passages
      quite instrumental in character, with nothing striking in them but the
      presupposition of an extraordinary soprano voice in the high&mdash;[See
      Page Image] to which they rise. This is apparently another concession made
      by Mozart to the "voluble throat" of his eldest sister-in-law, Madame
      Hofer (Vol. II., p. 330). There can be no difficulty in accrediting a
      sister of Aloysia Weber with the possession of a fabulously high voice;
      but it is remarkable that Schroder, who saw her in the same year (1791) as
      Oberon, should have said of her (Meyer, L. Schroder, II., 1, p. 85): "A
      very unpleasing singer; her voice is not high enough for the part, and she
      squeaks it, besides which she opens her mouth with a gape like the elder
      Stephanie." Nevertheless, she set no small store on herself, and must have
      been admired by a portion of the public; Mozart has made a still greater
      sacrifice to her in the second air, in which the Queen of Night commands
      her daughter to wreak vengeance on Sarastro. In design it is free and
      bold, in passionate expression of resentment very powerful; the two chief
      parts are both musically and dramatically striking, the close is genuinely
      pathetic, and the uniformly high position of the voice in conjunction with
      the forcible and somewhat shrilly toned instrumentation, is of very
      singular effect. All this notwithstanding, Mozart has allowed himself to
      be persuaded to ruin an aria which might have been a model of pathetic
      declamation by two long ornamental passages inserted between the parts of
      the air, which are not only destructive of proper effect, but also
      unnatural, and wanting in taste themselves. The Queen is attended by three
      ladies, who, however, have none of the vindictive qualities which
      distinguish her. Not <span class="side">THE THREE LADIES.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p335.png">[335]</a></span> only do we
      find unmistakable proofs of their original conception as good fairies, but
      the way in which they are treated in the opera has a spice of the drollery
      of Musäus or Wieland, although without their grace and refinement; the
      merit which they possess is entirely due to Mozart. They show themselves
      in their true colours from the first introduction. Tamino enters in
      terrified flight from a serpent,<a href="#linknote43-55"
      name="linknoteref43-55" id="linknoteref43-55"> 55 </a> which is
      well-expressed by the orchestra; at the moment when he is falling into a
      swoon, the three ladies appear and slay the monster. As they gaze on the
      beautiful youth, tender promptings fill their breasts; each wishes to
      remain with him and to send her companions with tidings to the Queen; a
      dispute arises which ends by their all three going, after a tender
      farewell to the insensible Tamino. The situation is represented with
      vivacity and humour in three well worked-out and varying movements, and
      although the ladies never display any lofty emotions, they move with so
      much natural grace that the not very refined situation makes an impression
      of unclouded cheerfulness. A long cadenza for the three voices, with which
      the movement originally closed, was judiciously struck out by Mozart
      himself.<a href="#linknote43-56" name="linknoteref43-56"
      id="linknoteref43-56"> 56 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies express themselves in similar fashion, though not quite so
      openly, seeing that they are not alone, in the quintet (6) when they
      deliver Papageno from his padlock, present him and Tamino with the flute
      and bells, and promise the companionship of the three boys. Here too, they
      are benevolent beings, bringing miraculous gifts, but not displaying any
      higher nature except when they mention the three boys, and even then the
      mysterious tone adopted belongs rather to the latter and the mysteries
      connected with them. Indeed, the teasing familiarity of the ladies to
      Papageno, and their coquettish politeness to Tamino, <span class="side">DIE
      ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p336.png">[336]</a></span>
      give them quite a <i>bourgeois</i> character, supported by the genial,
      jovial tone of the music, which is fresh, natural, and full of euphonious
      charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second quintet (13) the same ladies appear as opponents of the
      initiated, but their character has been already so clearly indicated that
      they cannot consistently turn into vindictive furies. They have the
      appropriate feminine task of inveigling Tamino and Papageno into breaking
      the silence which has been imposed on them, and, while easily
      accomplishing this, as far as Papageno is concerned, they find that Tamino
      is inflexible himself, and recalls Papageno to his duty. The object of the
      music, therefore, is not to bring a dismal or gloomy image before the
      mind, but to emphasise, without exaggerating, the comic element of the
      situation. The central point of interest is of course Papageno, who
      displays all the cowardice and loquacity of his nature to the ladies, and
      is only kept within bounds by his respect for Tamino; the ladies treat the
      interview almost as a joke, and even Tamino's steadfast determination
      acquires from its surroundings an involuntarily comic tone. The whole
      quintet is light and pleasing, destitute of any higher feeling, such as
      that of the first quartet; all the more striking is the effect of the
      powerful closing chords, to which the ladies, pursued by the initiated,
      depart with a cry of terror, while Papageno falls to the ground. The
      peculiar musical effect of this piece depends mainly upon the skill with
      which the female voices are employed;<a href="#linknote43-57"
      name="linknoteref43-57" id="linknoteref43-57"> 57 </a> where the male
      voices come in they are made to add to the combinations partly in contrast
      and partly in union with the female voices. The instrumentation is for the
      most part easy; in order to afford a firm foundation the two violins
      frequently go with the third voice instead of the bass, while wind
      instruments support the upper voices, which produces a clear, light, and
      yet powerful tone-colouring. The allegretto (6-8) in the introduction, in
      comparison with the two other movements of the <span class="side">THE MOOR&mdash;PAPAGENO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p337.png">[337]</a></span> same,
      or the passages in the first quintet, "bekamen doch die Lügner allé," "O
      so eine Flöte," "Silberglöckchen," and finally the announcement of the
      three boys may serve as examples of the union of orchestra and voices to
      produce a climax of novel and melodious effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moor Monostatos may also be considered as a follower of the Queen of
      Night, only left in attendance on Sarastro through the inconsistency of
      the adaptation, and made a renegade in order that the figure of a traitor
      to the order might not be omitted. He is never brought to the front,
      neither in the terzet, where he threatens Pamina and then runs away from
      Papageno, nor in the first finale, where he is made to dance by Papageno,
      and then bastinadoed by order of Sarastro. But in the second act, when he
      surprises Pamina asleep, he has a little song to sing (14) which is a
      miniature masterpiece of psychological dramatic characterisation.<a
      href="#linknote43-58" name="linknoteref43-58" id="linknoteref43-58"> 58
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The kingdom of Night is most strikingly characterised when the Queen and
      her ladies are introduced into the sanctuary by Monostatos to plot their
      revenge. The motif on which the movement rests&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      is graphically descriptive of the stealthy entry; the summons to the Queen
      of Night takes an expression of gloomy solemnity which stands in
      characteristic contrast to the dignified gravity of the priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papageno adds a third element to the temple priests and the kingdom of
      Night. Even the inevitable character of the comic servant received a novel
      colouring from the introduction of Masonic relations. The qualities of
      sensuality, cowardice, and loquacity, on which the comic effect depends,
      are here made typical of the natural man, who, destitute of the nobler and
      more refined impulses of the initiated, aspires to nothing beyond mere
      sensual gratification. This it maybe which causes Papageno to appear far
      less vulgar and offensive <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLöTE</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p338.png">[338]</a></span> than most of
      his fellows. It is true that his wit is destitute of refinement or humour,
      but his jokes, though silly, are healthy and natural to one side of the
      German character, which explains the fact of Papageno having become the
      favourite of a large part of the public. Although Schikaneder had
      doubtless a share in this popularity (he made the part to his own liking,
      and when he built his new theatre with the proceeds of the "Zauberflöte,"
      he had himself painted on the drop-scene as Papageno), all the essential
      merit of it is Mozart's own. To whatever extent Schikaneder may have
      helped him to the melodies, that he came to the aid of Mozart's inventive
      powers will be imagined by none, least of all by those who know that the
      simplest song requires science for its perfection, and that truth and
      beauty are made popular, not by debasing, but by simplifying them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papageno's songs are genuine specimens of German national music&mdash;gay
      and good-humoured, full of enjoyment of life and its pleasures. The first
      song (3), "Der Vogel-fänger bin ich ja," is unusually simple, with an
      extremely happy, sympathetic melody; the addition of horns, with the tones
      and passages natural to them, gives a freshness to the accompaniment; and
      the by-play on the reed-pipe (ever since called Papageno's flute)&mdash;[See
      Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      with the answer of the orchestra, has a really funny effect. The second
      song (21) is in two parts, differing in time and measure, but resembles
      the first in the tone of merry content which lies at the root of its
      popularity. Schikaneder may have given just the suggestion to the musical
      conception (Vol. III., p. 284), but the precise and well-rounded
      working-out is due to Mozart alone. Papageno's bells give a peculiar tone
      to the accompaniment, "eine Maschine wie ein holzemes Gelàchter," they are
      called in the libretto, and "istromento d' acciajo" by Mozart in the
      score; they were brought in for the ritornellos and interludes with easy
      variations in the different verses. The celebrated double-bass player
      Pischl-berger or, according to Treitschke, Kapellmeister <span class="side">PAPAGENO.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p339.png">[339]</a></span>
      Henneberg "hammered" the instrument behind the scenes. Mozart wrote to his
      wife at Baden how he had once played the bells himself behind the scenes:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      I amused myself by playing an arpeggio when Schikaneder came to a pause.
      He was startled, looked round, and saw me. The second time the pause
      occurred I did the same; then he stopped and would not go on; I guessed
      what he was after, and made another chord, upon which he tapped the bells
      and said: "Hold your tongue!" ("Halts Maul!"), whereupon everybody
      laughed. I fancy this was the first intimation to many people that he did
      not play the instrument himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instrument occurs first in the first finale, when Papageno makes the
      slaves of Monostatos dance and sing to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it is brought prominently forward, supporting the melody alone,
      accompanied only <i>pizzicato</i> by the stringed instruments, and in a
      measure by the chorus; the whole is most innocently simple, and of
      charming effect.<a href="#linknote43-59" name="linknoteref43-59"
      id="linknoteref43-59"> 59 </a> The bells exercise their power a third time
      (the magic flute is also; played three times) in the last finale, where
      the magic instrument aids the despairing Papageno to recall his Papagena,
      and is treated simply as befits its nature.<a href="#linknote43-60"
      name="linknoteref43-60" id="linknoteref43-60"> 60 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Papageno's chief scene is in the last finale, when he resolves to die for
      the love of his lost Papagena, and it forms a counterpart to the pathetic
      scene of Pamina's despair. An expression of good-humour and of true, if
      not very elevated, feeling prevents the comic situation from becoming
      farcical.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLöTE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p340.png">[340]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Papageno's grief is like that of a child, expressed in genuine earnest,
      yet of a nature to raise a smile on the lips of grownup people. This
      double nature is well expressed, for example, in the violin passage&mdash;[See
      Page Image]nwhich has something comic in its very accents of grief. The
      form of this lengthy scene is altogether free. Without alteration of time
      or measure the music follows the various points of the scene, declamatory
      passages interrupting the long-drawn threads of melody sometimes with
      great effect, and descriptive phrases repeated at suitable places to keep
      the whole together. Thus the characteristic passage&mdash;occurs three
      times to the words: "Drum geschieht es mir schon recht!" "Sterben macht
      der Lieb' ein End," and "Papageno frisch hinauf, en.de deinen Lebenslauf!"
      At the close, when he seems really on the point of hanging himself, the
      time becomes slower, and a minor key serves to express the gloom of
      despair. But the three boys appear and remind him of his bells; at once
      his courage rises, and as he tinkles the bells he calls upon his
      sweetheart to appear with all the confidence and joy of a child. At the
      command of the boys he looks round, sees her, and the two feather-clothed
      beings contemplate each other with amazement and delight, approaching
      nearer and nearer, until at last they fall into each other's arms. The
      comic point of the stammering "Pa-pa-pa-," uttered by them both, slowly at
      first, then with increasing rapidity until they embrace with the
      exclamation, Papageno!" and "Papagena!" was due to Schickaneder's <span
      class="side">LOVE OF MAN AND WIFE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p341.png">[341]</a></span> suggestion.<a
      href="#linknote43-61" name="linknoteref43-61" id="linknoteref43-61"> 61
      </a> That the happiness they feel at their reunion should find expression
      in anticipating the advent of numerous little Papagenos and Papagenas is
      not only intended as a trait of human nature unrestrained and unrefined in
      thought and word, but serves to point to the parental joys springing from
      wedlock as "the highest of all emotions." The duet originally ended with
      the words (which Mozart did not set to music):&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Wenn dann die Kleinen um sie spielen
     Die Eltern gleiche Freude fühlen,
     Sich ihres Ebenbildes freun
     O, welch ein Gluck kann grosser sein?
</pre>
    <p>
      The words with which the boys lead Papagena to Papageno&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Komm her, du holdes, liebes Weibchen!
     Dem Mann sollst du dein Herzchen weihn.
     Er wird dich lieben, süsses Weibchen,
     Dein Vater, Freund und Brader sein
     Sie dieses Mannes Eigenthum!
</pre>
    <p>
      were also omitted by Mozart, because serious exhortations and moral
      reflections would have been out of place here. He has instead succeeded in
      producing so lively and natural an expression of childlike delight,
      untouched by any taint of sensual desire, that the hearer feels his own
      heart full of happiness for very sympathy. The companion piece to this
      duet is that which Papageno sings with Pamina, after informing her that
      Tamino, fired with love, is hastening to her release (8). There can be no
      doubt that Mozart's wish has been to express the loftiest conception of
      the love of man and wife as an image, however faint and imperfect, of
      heavenly love; but here again Schikaneder has interposed, and insisted on
      something popular. We cannot blame him, for Papageno's sphere is that of
      natural, simple sentiment, not of enlightened morality, and Pamina is an
      inexperienced girl, who follows her own feelings, and is ready enough to
      fall into Papageno's vein.

    <p>
      Mozart did not find it easy to satisfy Schikaneder, who called each fresh
      attempt fine, but too learned; not until the third, or as some say, the
      fifth version,<a href="#linknote43-62" name="linknoteref43-62"
      id="linknoteref43-62"> 62 </a> did Mozart hit on the simple tone of warm
      feeling which Schikaneder believed would win every ear and every heart.
      His judgment proved correct; at the first performance this was the first
      piece applauded, and an angry critic complained in 1793 that the
      "Mozartites" were passing all bounds, and that "at every concert the
      ladies' heads went nodding like poppies in the field when the senseless
      stuff was sung: 'Mann und Weib, und Weib und Mann (which makes four, by
      the way), reichen an die Gottheit an.'"<a href="#linknote43-63"
      name="linknoteref43-63" id="linknoteref43-63"> 63 </a> According to
      Kapellmeister Trüben-see, of Prague, who was engaged as oboist in
      Schikaneder's opera, a rejected composition of this duet in the grand
      style was afterwards made use of alternately with that now known, and
      indicated on the playbill, "with the old duet" or "with the new duet."<a

      bill:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having been so fortunate as myself to possess the friendship of Mozart,
      whose affection for me led him to set my work to music, I am in a position
      to offer the audience on this occasion a gratifying surprise in the form
      of two pieces of Mozart's composition, of which I am sole possessor.<a

      id="linknoteref43-66"> 66 </a> An individuality such as Papageno's is sure
      to impart some of its naïve good humour and joviality to the other
      characters with whom he comes in contact, and the impression thus made
      cannot <span class="side">ENSEMBLES.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p343.png">[343]</a></span> fail to appear in the music;
      whenever Papageno enters, whether he is merry or whether he is sad, an
      irresistible tone of good humour takes possession of the stage. Next to
      him in want of reserve and self-control stands Pamina, who only gradually
      attains a consciousness of her higher and nobler nature. Neither in the
      duet nor in the flight does her expression of the feelings they are both
      experiencing differ in tone from Papageno's; any marked distinction here
      would have marred the total impression without assisting psychological
      truth. But on the approach of Sarastro they draw apart; Pamina entrenches
      herself in proud reserve, while Papageno gives vent to his terror with the
      same energy as in the first quintet (6) when he is ordered to accompany
      Tamino to the castle. In the second quintet (13) his fright is kept in
      check by Tamino's presence, and his disgust at not daring to speak, and
      not being able to keep silence, gains the upper hand and gives the tone to
      the whole piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a consideration as we have given to the principal characters of the
      "Zauberflöte," to its intellectual and musical conception, and to the
      prevailing freedom of its form, serves to stamp its character as a
      genuinely German opera. What was begun in the "Entführung," which
      undertook to raise German vaudeville to the level of opera proper, is
      carried further in the "Zauberflöte," which succeeds in gaining
      recognition for the simplest expression of feeling, and for full freedom
      of form of dramatic characterisation. The opera contains no airs of the
      traditional stamp, except the two airs of the Queen of Night; and a
      comparison of the way in which the aria form is treated in "Cosi fan
      Tutte" and "Titus" will show an organic change in the airs, now that they
      are developed from the simple Lied. This freedom of construction is still
      more apparent in the ensembles, in the beautiful terzet (20), and more
      especially in the first quintet (6). The second quintet (13) is more
      precise in form, the ladies tempting Tamino and Papageno to break silence
      forming the natural middle point of the musical construction. But the
      freedom of movement strikes us most of all in the finales, which are
      admirable examples of <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p344.png">[344]</a></span> the art, so
      praised by Goethe, of producing effect by means of contrast. In dramatic
      design they are inferior to the finales of "Figaro," "Don Giovanni," or
      "Cosi fan Tutte." Instead of a plot proceeding from one point, and
      developing as it proceeds, we have a succession of varied scenes, lightly
      held together by the thread of events, and interesting us more from their
      variety than their consistent development. In order to follow this rapid
      movement great freedom of musical construction was necessary;
      opportunities of carrying out a definite motif till it forms a
      self-contained movement, which are so frequent in Italian finales, occur
      here but seldom, one instance being the allegro of the first finale, when
      Monostatos brings in Tamino, and the movement of the second finale to
      which the Queen of Night enters. This essential difference of treatment
      fills us with renewed admiration of Mozart's fertility in the production
      of new suggestive and characteristic melodies, which seem ready at command
      for every possible situation. Those who descend to details will be amazed
      to find how seldom Mozart is satisfied with a mere turn of expression, how
      lavish he is of original fully formed musical subjects, and how all the
      details of his work are cemented into a whole by his marvellous union of
      artistic qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads us to the consideration of a second point in which the
      "Zauberflöte" surpasses the "Entführung." The latter is confined to a
      narrow circle of characters, situations, and moods, while the former has a
      large and varied series of phenomena. The story from which the plot is
      derived opens the realm of fairies and genü, personified in the Queen of
      the Night and her ladies, and, as regards his outward appearance, in
      Papageno. In addition to this there is the mystical element which takes
      the first place both in the dramatic conception and the musical
      characterisation of the opera. Mozart had no intention of representing a
      fantastic fairy land, such as was called into existence by Weber and
      Mendelssohn. The fabulous was not then identified with the fantastic, but
      was often consciously made a mirror for the reflection of real life, with
      its actual sentiments and views. Therefore the Queen of Night is depicted
      as a queen, <span class="side">FANTASTIC AND MYSTIC ELEMENTS.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p345.png">[345]</a></span> as a
      sorrowing mother, as a revengeful woman; her ladies have their share of
      coquetry and gossip, and these feminine qualities predominate over the
      supernatural. The musical task of combining three soprano voices into a
      connected whole, while preserving their individuality, calls for great
      peculiarity of treatment, entailing further a special turning to account
      of the orchestral forces at command, at the same time that no special
      forms of expression are made to serve as typical of the fairy element of
      the piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand the apparition of the three boys is accompanied by every
      means of musical characterisation. They form the link with the region of
      mysticism indicated awkwardly enough in the libretto. We recognise
      something more than individual taste and inclination in Mozart's efforts
      to invest them with a character of grave solemnity. A universal and
      deep-rooted sympathy with Freemasonry was a characteristic sign of the
      times, and the German mind and disposition are well expressed in the
      efforts that were made to find in Freemasonry that unity which
      intellectual cultivation and moral enlightenment alone could bestow.
      Mozart was therefore at one in intention and aim with all that was highest
      and noblest in the nation, and the more deeply his own feelings were
      stirred the more sure he was to stamp his music with all that was truly
      German in character. It was not without design that he selected an old
      choral melody to mark a point of most solemn gravity, or that he treated
      it in the way with which his fellow-countrymen were most familiar. This
      passage is also significant as showing the marvellous element in a
      symbolic light, and bringing the supernatural within the domain of the
      human sphere. In this respect the representation of the marvellous in the
      "Zauberflöte" differs widely from that in "Don Giovanni." There the
      appearance of the ghost is a veritable miracle, a fact which must be
      believed to be such, and rendered to the minds of the spectators by means
      of the musical representation of terror in the actors. In the
      "Zauberflöte," on the contrary, the marvellous element is suggested only
      by the mystery hidden beneath it, and the mind is attuned to a mood of
      awe-struck wonder.

    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be denied that the deeply rooted symbolism of the opera has
      dulled the edge of individual characterisation. Actions lose their reality
      and become mere tests of virtue; the choruses of the priests express
      generalities; neither the three ladies nor the three boys are independent
      characters, but each group forms an individual, which again represents an
      idea; even the principal characters, owing to the concentration of all
      upon one idea, have more of a typical character than is desirable in the
      interests of dramatic characterisation.<a href="#linknote43-67"
      name="linknoteref43-67" id="linknoteref43-67"> 67 </a> In spite of these
      drawbacks Mozart has depicted both his situations and characters naturally
      and vividly. No one will attempt to deny that both the subjects and
      treatment of "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni," and in some degree also of "Cosi
      fan Tutte," present far more occasions for the expression of passion, for
      delicate detail, and for the emphasising of special features, than is the
      case with the "Zauberflöte," where the effect depends mainly on the
      general impression left by the whole work; but that this is the case
      affords only another proof of Mozart's power of grasping the strong points
      of every problem that was set before him. "In Lessing's 'Nathan,'" says
      Strauss,<a href="#linknote43-68" name="linknoteref43-68"
      id="linknoteref43-68"> 68 </a> "we are as little disposed to complain of
      the want of that powerful impression produced by his more pungent pieces,
      as we are to wish the peaceful echoes of Mozart's 'Zauberflöte' exchanged
      for the varied characterisation and foaming passion of the music of 'Don
      Juan.' In the last work of the musician, as in that of the poet, wide
      apart as they stand in other respects, there is revealed a perfected
      spirit at peace with itself, which having fought and overcome all
      opposition from within, has no longer to dread that which comes from
      without."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the words of the opera were in German had doubtless an
      important influence on the musical expression. Wretched as the verses are,
      so much so that it is difficult sometimes to find the sense necessary for
      the proper understanding of Mozart's rendering of them, they nevertheless
      <span class="side">THE ORCHESTRA.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p347.png">[347]</a></span> form the basis of the musical
      construction. Italian operatic poetry, long since stereotyped in form,
      fettered the composer's fancy, while the German verses, from their very
      want of finish, left him freer scope for independent action. It is worthy
      of note that instrumental tone-painting, so frequently employed in Italian
      opera as a means of giving musical expression to the poetry, is but little
      resorted to in the "Zauberflöte." Apart from the difference of poetical
      expression in Italian and German, the sensuous sound of the Italian
      language was far more provocative of musical expression; and the
      declamatory element of correct accentuation and phrasing was at the root
      of the correct musical expression of German words. In this respect also
      the "Zauberflöte" is far superior to the "Entführung." A comparison of the
      text with the music will show what pains Mozart has taken to declaim
      expressively and forcibly. Sometimes the effort is too apparent, as in
      Sarastro's well-known "Doch"; but as a rule Mozart's musical instinct
      prevents the declamatory element from intruding itself to the detriment of
      the melodious.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the treatment of the orchestra also the "Zauberflöte" stands alone
      among Mozart's operas. It is not, as in "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni,"
      employed for delicate details of characterisation, nor is it, as in "Cosi
      fan Tutte" replete with euphonious charm. It has here a double part: in
      that portion of the opera which represents purely human emotion the
      orchestra is free and independent in movement, but easy and simple in
      construction; while for the mystic element of the story it has quite
      another character: Unusual means, such as trombones and basset-horns, are
      employed for the production of unusual and weird effects, while through
      all the delicate gradations of light and shade, from melancholy gravity to
      brilliant pomp, the impression of dignity and solemnity is. maintained,
      and the hearer is transported to a sphere beyond all earthly passion. Not
      only are the hitherto unsuspected forces of the orchestra here brought
      into play, but its power of characterisation is for the first time made <i>fully</i>
      manifest, and the "Zauberflöte" is the point of departure for all that
      modern music has achieved in this <span class="side">DIE ZAUBERFLÖTE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p348.png">[348]</a></span>
      direction. It must not, however, be forgotten that instrumental colouring
      is always to Mozart one means among many of interpreting his artistic
      idea, and never aspires to be its sole exponent, or to overshadow it
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which gives the "Zauberflöte" its peculiar position and importance
      among Mozart's operas is the fact that in it for the first time all the
      resources of cultivated art were brought to bear with the freedom of
      genius upon a genuinely German opera.<a href="#linknote43-69"
      name="linknoteref43-69" id="linknoteref43-69"> 69 </a> In his Italian
      operas he had adopted the traditions of a long period of development, and
      by virtue of his original genius had, as it were, brought them to a climax
      and a conclusion; in the "Zauberflöte" he stepped across the threshold of
      the future, and unlocked the sanctuary of national art for his countrymen.
      And they understood him; the "Zauberflöte" sank directly and deeply into
      the hearts of the German people, and to this day it holds its place there.
      The influence which it has exerted in the formation of German music can be
      disregarded by no one who has an eye for the development of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidence of the rapid popularity of the "Zauberflöte" is afforded by the
      imitations of it which were produced at the theatres Auf der Wieden and
      Leopoldstadt:&mdash;

    <p>
      Everything is turned to magic at these theatres; we have the magic flute,
      the magic ring, the magic arrow, the magic mirror, the magic crown, and
      many other wretched magic affairs. Words and music are equally
      contemptible (except the "Zauberflöte"), so that one knows not whether to
      award the palm of silliness to the poet or the composer. Added to this,
      these miserable productions are still more miserably performed.<a

      Schikaneder's opera, "Babylons Pyramiden," the first act composed by

      The "Zauberflöte" rapidly gained popularity for Mozart's name, especially
      in North Germany. How universal was the favour with which it soon came to
      be regarded may be testified by Goethe, who makes his Hermann, describing
      a visit to his neighbour in their little country town, say:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Minchen sass am Klavier; es war der Vater zugegen,
     Hörte die Tochterchen singen, und war entzückt und in Laune.
     Manches verstand ich nicht, was in den Liedern gesagt war;
     Aber ich hörte viel von Pamina, viel von Tamino,
     Und ich wollte doch auch nicht stumm sein! Sobald sie geendet,
     Fragt' ich dem Texte nach, und nach den beiden Personen.

      Even to this day Sarastro and Tamino are regular starring and trial parts;
      unhappily, so is the Queen of Night for singers who possess the high F;
      and though the novelty and splendour of the scenery and stage accessories
      have been long since surpassed, and the interest in Freemasonry has died
      away, yet the "Zauberflöte" is still popular in the best sense of the
      word. It has been successfully performed in Dutch,<a href="#linknote43-88"

      The "Zauberflöte" was given in Paris in 1791 curiously transformed by
      Lachnith under the title of "Jes Mystères d'Isis."<a href="#linknote43-97"
      name="linknoteref43-97" id="linknoteref43-97"> 97 </a> The piece was
      irrecognisable; everything miraculous, including the magic flute itself,
      and everything comic was omitted, Papageno being turned into the wise
      shepherd Bochoris; this, of course, involved the parodying of a great part
      of the music, and much was omitted even without this excuse. The omissions
      were made good by the insertion of pieces out of other operas by Mozart,
      e.g., the drinking-song from "Don Giovanni" arranged as a duet, an air
      from "Titus," also as a duet, and more of the same kind. Great liberties
      were taken with the music itself. The closing chorus, with Sarastro's
      recitative, formed the beginning of the opera; then followed the terzet
      "Seid uns zum zweiten-mal willkommen," sung by six priestesses; then a
      chorus from "Titus" (15); and then the original introduction. Monostatos'
      song was given to Papagena (Mona), the first air of the Queen of Night to
      Pamina, and the duet "Bei Mannern" was turned into a terzet. It can easily
      be imagined how distorted Mozart's music was by all these additions,
      erasures, and alterations. The performance called forth lively protests
      from the critics and connoisseurs,<a href="#linknote43-98"

      101 </a> But all were agreed as to the excellence of the scenery and

      NO sooner was the "Zauberflöte" completed and performed than Mozart set to
      work with restless eagerness upon his still unfinished Requiem.<a
      href="#linknote44-1" name="linknoteref44-1" id="linknoteref44-1"> 1 </a>
      His friend, Jos. von Jacquin, calling upon him one day to request him to
      give pianoforte lessons to a lady who was already an admirable performer
      on the instrument, found him at his writing-table, hard at work on the
      Requiem. Mozart readily acceeded to the request, provided he might
      postpone the lessons for a time; "for," said he, "I have a work on hand
      which lies very near my heart, and until that is finished I can think of
      nothing else."<a href="#linknote44-2" name="linknoteref44-2"
      id="linknoteref44-2"> 2 </a> Other friends remembered <span class="side">SAD

      afterwards how engrossed he had been in his task up to a very short time
      before his death.<a href="#linknote44-3" name="linknoteref44-3"
      id="linknoteref44-3"> 3 </a> The feverish excitement with which he
      laboured at it increased the indisposition which had attacked him at
      Prague. Even before the completion of the "Zauberflöte" he had become
      subject to fainting fits which exhausted his strength and increased his
      depression. The state of Mozart's mind at this time may be gathered from a
      curious note in Italian, written by him in September, 1791, to an unknown
      friend (Da Ponte? cf.,
    </p>
    <p>
      Affmo Signore,&mdash;Vorrei seguire il vostro consiglio, ma come
      riuscirvi? ho il capo frastemato, conto a forza e non posso levarmi dagli
      occhi 1' immagine di questo incognito. Lo vedo di continuo, esso mi prega,
      mi sollecita, ed impaziente mi chiede il lavoro. Continuo perché il
      comporre mi stanca meno del riposo. Altronde non ho più da tremere. Lo
      sento a quel che provo, che l' ora suona; sono in procinto di spirare; ho
      finito prima di aver goduto del mio talento. La vita era pur si bella, la
      camera s' apriva sotto auspici tanto fortunati, ma non si puö cangiar il
      proprio destino. Nessuno micura [assicura] i propri giomi, bisogna
      rassenarsi, sarà quel che piacerà alla providenza, termino ecco il mio
      canto funebre, non devo lasciarlo imperfetto.

    <p>
      It was in vain that his wife, who had returned from Baden, sought to
      withdraw him from his work, and to induce him to seek relief from gloomy
      thoughts in the society of his friends.<a href="#linknote44-5"
      name="linknoteref44-5" id="linknoteref44-5"> 5 </a> One beautiful day,
      when they had driven to the Prater, and were sitting there quite alone,
      Mozart began to speak of death, and told his wife, with tears in his eyes,
      that he was writing his Requiem for himself. "I feel it too well," he
      continued; "my end is drawing near. I must have taken poison; I cannot get
      this idea out of my mind."<a href="#linknote44-6" name="linknoteref44-6"
      id="linknoteref44-6"> 6 </a> Horrified at this disclosure, Frau Mozart
      sought, <span class="side">ILLNESS AND DEATH.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p354.png">[354]</a></span> by every possible argument, to
      reason him out of such imaginations.<a href="#linknote44-7"
      name="linknoteref44-7" id="linknoteref44-7"> 7 </a> Fully persuaded that
      the assiduity with which he was working at the Requiem was increasing his
      illness, she took the score away from him and called in a medical adviser,
      Dr. Closset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some improvement in Mozart's state of health followed, and he was able to
      compose a cantata written by Schikaneder for a Masonic festival (623 K.),
      which was finished November 15, and the first performance conducted by
      himself. He was so pleased with the execution of this work, and with the
      applause it received, that his courage and pleasure in his art revived,
      and he was ready to believe that his idea of having taken poison was a
      result of his diseased imagination. He demanded the score of the Requiem
      from his wife, who gave it to him without any misgiving. The improvement,
      however, was of short duration, and Mozart soon relapsed into his former
      state of melancholy, talked much of having been poisoned, and grew weaker
      and weaker. His hands and feet began to swell, and partial paralysis set
      in, accompanied by violent vomiting. Good old Joseph Deiner (Vol. II., p.
      300) used to tell how Mozart had come to him in November, 1791, looking
      wretched, and complaining of illness. He directed him to come to his house
      next morning to receive his wife's orders for their <span class="side">SERIOUS
      ILLNESS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p355.png">[355]</a></span>
      winter supply of fuel. Deiner kept the appointment, but was informed by
      the maid-servant that her master had become so ill during the night that
      she had been obliged to fetch the doctor. The wife called him into the
      bedroom where Mozart was in bed. When he heard Deiner he opened his eyes
      and said, almost inaudibly, "Not to-day, Joseph; we have to do with
      doctors and apothecaries to-day."<a href="#linknote44-8"
      name="linknoteref44-8" id="linknoteref44-8"> 8 </a> On November 28 his
      condition was so critical that Dr. Closset called into consultation Dr.
      Sallaba, chief physician at the hospital. During the fortnight that he was
      confined to bed consciousness never left him. The idea of death was ever
      before his eyes, and he looked forward to it with composure, albeit loth
      to part with life. The success of the "Zauberflöte" seemed likely at last
      to open the door to fame and fortune; and during his last days of life he
      was assured of an annual subscription of one thousand florins from some of
      the Hungarian nobility, and of a still larger yearly sum from Amsterdam,
      in return for the periodical production of some few compositions
      exclusively for the subscribers.<a href="#linknote44-9"
      name="linknoteref44-9" id="linknoteref44-9"> 9 </a> It was hard to leave
      his art just when he was put in a position to devote himself to it,
      unharassed by the daily pressure of poverty; hard, too, to leave his wife
      and his two little children to an anxious and uncertain future.<a
      href="#linknote44-10" name="linknoteref44-10" id="linknoteref44-10"> 10
      </a> Sometimes these ideas overpowered him, but generally he was tranquil
      and resigned, and never betrayed the slightest impatience. He unwillingly
      allowed his canary, of which he was very fond, to be removed to the next
      room, that he might not be disturbed by its noise. It was afterwards
      carried still farther out of hearing. Sophie Haibl says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was taken ill we made him night-shirts which could be put on
      without giving him the pain of turning round; and, not realising how ill
      he was, we made him a wadded dressing-gown against the time that he should
      be able to sit up; it amused him very much to follow our work as it
      proceeded. I came to him daily. Once he said to me,
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">ILLNESS AND DEATH.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p356.png">[356]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell the mother that I am going on very well, and that I shall be able to
      come and offer my congratulations on her fête-day (November 22) within the
      week."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard with intense interest of the repetition of the "Zauberflote," and
      when evening came he used to lay his watch beside him, and follow the
      performance in imagination: "Now the first act is over&mdash;now comes the
      mighty Queen of Night."<a href="#linknote44-11" name="linknoteref44-11"
      id="linknoteref44-11"> 11 </a> The day before his death he said to his
      wife: "I should like to have heard my 'Zauberflote' once more," and began
      to hum the birdcatcher's song in a scarcely audible voice. Kapellmeister
      Roser, who was sitting at his bedside, went to the piano and sang the
      song, to Mozart's evident delight.<a href="#linknote44-12"
      name="linknoteref44-12" id="linknoteref44-12"> 12 </a> The Requiem, too,
      was constantly in his mind. While he had been at work upon it he used to
      sing every number as it was finished, playing the orchestral part on the
      piano. The afternoon before his death he had the score brought to his bed,
      and himself sang the alto part.<a href="#linknote44-13"
      name="linknoteref44-13" id="linknoteref44-13"> 13 </a> Schack, as usual,
      took the soprano, Hofer, Mozart's brother-in-law, the tenor, and Gerl the
      bass. They got as far as the first bars of the Lacrimosa when Mozart, with
      the feeling that it would never be finished, burst into a violent fit of
      weeping, and laid the score aside.<a href="#linknote44-14"
      name="linknoteref44-14" id="linknoteref44-14"> 14 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When Frau Haibl came towards evening her sister, who was not usually
      wanting in self-control, met her in a state of agitation at the door,
      exclaiming: "Thank God you are here! He was so ill last night, I thought
      he could not live through the day; if it comes on again, he must die in
      the night." Seeing her at his bedside, Mozart said: "I am glad you are
      here; stay with me to-night, and see me die." Controlling her emotion, she
      strove to reason him out of such thoughts, but he answered: "I have the
      flavour of death on my <span class="side">THE END.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p357.png">[357]</a></span> tongue&mdash;I
      taste death; and who will support my dearest Constanze if you do not stay
      with her?" She left him for a moment to carry the tidings to her mother,
      who was looking anxiously for them. At her sister's wish she went to the
      priests of St. Peter's, and begged that one might be sent to Mozart as if
      by chance; they refused for a long time, and it was with difficulty she
      persuaded "these clerical barbarians" to grant her request. When she
      returned she found Süssmayr at Mozart's bedside in earnest conversation
      over the Requiem. "Did I not say that I was writing the Requiem for
      myself?" said he, looking at it through his tears. And he was so convinced
      of his approaching death that he enjoined his wife to inform
      Albrechtsberger of it before it became generally known, in order that he
      might secure Mozart's place at the Stephanskirche, which belonged to him
      by every right (Vol. II., p. 277, note). Late in the evening the physician
      arrived, having been long sought, and found in the theatre, which he could
      not persuade himself to leave before the conclusion of the piece. He told
      Süssmayr in confidence that there was no hope, but ordered cold bandages
      round the head, which caused such violent shuddering that delirium and
      unconsciousness came on, from which Mozart never recovered. Even in his
      latest fancies he was busy with the Requiem, blowing out his cheeks to
      imitate the trumpets and drums. Towards midnight he raised himself, opened
      his eyes wide, then lay down with his face to the wall, and seemed to fall
      asleep. At one o'clock (December 5) he expired.<a href="#linknote44-15"

      At early morning the faithful Deiner was roused by the maid-servant "to
      come and dress" her master; he went at once and performed the last
      friendly offices for Mozart. The body was clothed in a black robe and laid
      on a bier, which was carried into the sitting-room and deposited near the
      piano. A constant flow of visitors mourned and wept as they gazed on him;
      those who had known him intimately loved him; his fame as an artist had
      become universal, and his sudden death brought home to all men the extent
      of their <span class="side">ILLNESS AND DEATH.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p358.png">[358]</a></span> loss. The "Wiener Zeitung"
      (1791, No. 98) made the following announcement:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have to announce with regret the death of the Imperial Court Composer,
      Wolfgang Mozart, which took place between four and five o'clock this
      morning. Famous throughout Europe from earliest childhood for his singular
      musical genius, he had developed his natural gifts, and by dint of study
      had raised himself to an equality with the greatest masters; his
      universally favourite and admired compositions testify to this fact, and
      enable us to estimate the irreparable loss which the musical world has
      sustained in his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter from Prague, of December 12, 1791, announced:<a
      href="#linknote44-16" name="linknoteref44-16" id="linknoteref44-16"> 16
      </a>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart is&mdash;dead. He returned from Prague in a state of suffering,
      which gradually increased; dropsy set in, and he died in Vienna at the end
      of last week. The swelling of his body after death led to the suspicion of
      his having been poisoned. His last work was a funeral Mass, which was
      performed at his obsequies. His death will cause the Viennese to realise
      for the first time what they have lost in him.<a href="#linknote44-17"
      name="linknoteref44-17" id="linknoteref44-17"> 17 </a> His life was
      troubled by the constant machination of cabals, whose enmity was doubtless
      sometimes provoked by his <i>sans souci</i> manner. Neither his "Figaro"
      nor his "Don Juan" were as enthusiastically received in Vienna as they
      were in Prague. Peace be to his ashes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mozart's wife, who had been so unwell the day before his death that the
      physician had prescribed for her, was rendered completely prostrate in
      mind and body by his death. In her despair she lay down upon his bed,
      desiring to be seized with the same illness, and to die with him. Van
      Swieten, who had hastened to bring her what consolation and assistance he
      could, persuaded her to leave the house of death, and to take up her abode
      for the present with some friends living near. He undertook the care of
      the funeral, and having regard to the needy circumstances of the widow, he
      made the necessary arrangements as simply and cheaply as possible. The
      funeral expenses (on the scale of the third class) amounted to 8 fl. 36
      kr., and there was an additional charge of 3 fl. for the hearse. Rich man
      and distinguished patron <span class="side">INTERMENT AND GRAVE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p359.png">[359]</a></span> as he
      was, it seems never to have occurred to Van Swieten that it would have
      been becoming in him to undertake the cost as well as the care of a
      fitting burial for the greatest genius of his age. At three o'clock in the
      afternoon of December 6 the corpse of Mozart received the benediction in
      the transept chapel on the north side of St. Stephen's Church. A violent
      storm of snow and rain was raging, and the few friends who were assembled&mdash;among
      them Van Swieten, Salieri, Süssmayr, Kapellm. Roser, and the violoncellist
      Orsler<a href="#linknote44-18" name="linknoteref44-18"
      id="linknoteref44-18"> 18 </a>&mdash;stood under umbrellas round the bier,
      which, was then carried through the Schulerstrasse to the churchyard of
      St. Mark's. The storm continued to rage so fiercely that the mourners
      decided upon turning back before they reached their destination,<a
      href="#linknote44-19" name="linknoteref44-19" id="linknoteref44-19"> 19
      </a> and not a friend stood by when the body of Mozart was lowered into
      the grave. For reasons of economy no grave had been bought, and the corpse
      was consigned to a common vault, made to contain from fifteen to twenty
      coffins, which was dug up about every ten years and filled anew: no stone
      marked the resting-place of Mozart. Good old Deiner, who had been present
      at the benediction, asked the widow if she did not intend to erect a cross
      to the departed; she answered that there was to be one. She no doubt
      imagined that the priest who had performed the ceremony would see to the
      erection of the cross. When she was sufficiently recovered from her first
      grief to visit the churchyard, she found a fresh gravedigger, who was
      unable to point out Mozart's grave; and all her inquiries after it were
      fruitless. Thus it is that, in spite of repeated attempts to discover it,
      the resting-place of Mozart remains unknown.<a href="#linknote44-20"

      Poor Constanze and her two children were now placed in the saddest
      possible position. Not more than sixty florins of ready money were
      available at Mozart's death; to this might be added 133 fl. 20 kr. of
      outstanding accounts, the furniture, wardrobe, and scanty library, which
      were valued at less than 400 florins. But there were debts to be paid, not
      only to generous creditors like Puchberg, who rendered every assistance in
      settling the affairs of his deceased friend without any thought of his own
      claim, but to workmen and tradesmen, who must be paid at all costs; the
      doctor's bill alone amounted to 250 florins.<a href="#linknote44-21"
      name="linknoteref44-21" id="linknoteref44-21"> 21 </a> In this emergency,
      Constanze appealed first to the generosity of the Emperor. One of Mozart's
      attached pupils informed her that the Emperor had been very unfavourably
      disposed towards her, in consequence of the calumnies spread abroad by
      Mozart's enemies to the effect that his dissipation and extravagance had
      involved him in debts amounting to more than 30,000 florins; and she was
      advised to make her application in person, so as to persuade the Emperor
      of the falsehood of such reports.<a href="#linknote44-22"
      name="linknoteref44-22" id="linknoteref44-22"> 22 </a> At the audience
      which was granted to her, she boldly declared that Mozart's great genius
      had raised up enemies against him, who had embittered his existence by
      their intrigues and calumnies. These slanderers had multiplied tenfold the
      amount of his debts, and she was prepared to satisfy all claims with a sum
      of 3,000 florins. Even this amount of liability was not the result of
      thoughtless extravagance, but had been inevitably incurred by the
      uncertainty of their income, by frequent illnesses and unforeseen calls on
      their resources. Appeased by Frau Mozart's representations, the Emperor
      encouraged her to give a concert, in which he took so generous an interest
      that the proceeds enabled her to pay all her husband's debts. <span

      ONE of the first cares of Mozart's widow was the Requiem (626 K.).<a
      href="#linknote45-1" name="linknoteref45-1" id="linknoteref45-1"> 1 </a>
      Mozart having left it unfinished, she could not but fear that the Unknown
      would not only refuse to complete the stipulated payment, but would demand
      the return of what had been already paid. In this dilemma, she called
      various friends into counsel, and hit upon the idea of continuing such
      portions of the work as Mozart had left, and of presenting it entire to
      the Unknown. The completion was first intrusted to Joh. Eybler;<a
      href="#linknote45-2" name="linknoteref45-2" id="linknoteref45-2"> 2 </a>

    <p>
      The undersigned hereby acknowledges that the widow Frau Konstanze Mozart
      has intrusted to him, for completion, the Requiem begun by her late
      husband. He undertakes to finish it by the middle of the ensuing Lent; and
      also gives his assurance that it shall neither be copied nor given into
      other hands than those of the widow.

    <p>
      Vienna, December 21, 1791.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began his task by filling in the instrumentation in Mozart's manuscript
      as far as the Confutatis, <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p362.png">[362]</a></span> and writing
      two bars of a continuation of the Lacrimosa,<a href="#linknote45-3"
      name="linknoteref45-3" id="linknoteref45-3"> 3 </a> but he then abandoned
      the work in despair. Other musicians seem to have declined it after him
      until it finally fell to the lot of Süssmayr. He had been Mozart's pupil
      in composition, had lent a hand in "Titus" (p. 288), and had often gone
      over the parts of the Requiem already composed with Mozart, who had
      consulted him as to the working-out of the composition and the principal
      points of the instrumentation. The widow, at a later time, said to
      Stadler:
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mozart grew weaker Süssmayr had often to sing through with him and me
      what had been written, and thus received regular instruction from Mozart.
      I seem to hear Mozart saying, as he often did: "Ah, the oxen are on the
      hill again! You have not, mastered that yet, by a long way."<a
      href="#linknote45-4" name="linknoteref45-4" id="linknoteref45-4"> 4 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This expression was also well remembered by her sister Sophie, and we can
      enter into it, remembering the manner in which Mozart himself wrote and
      developed his compositions (Vol. II., p. 423).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first two movements, Requiem and Kyrie, were finished and written out
      in full score by Mozart; there can be no question about them.<a
      href="#linknote45-5" name="linknoteref45-5" id="linknoteref45-5"> 5 </a>
      The Dies iræ was sketched out in his usual way, the voice parts completely
      written out, together with the fundamental bass&mdash;sometimes figured&mdash;and
      the instrumental parts where they had to go without the voices; where the
      accompaniment was at all independent the subject was indicated
      sufficiently clearly to be carried on and filled in subsequently. The
      score was left in this state as far as the last verse of the Dies iræ;
      Mozart stopped at the words:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Qua resurget ex favilla
     Iudicandus homo reus.
</pre>
    <p>

      <span class="side">SUSSMAYR'S WORK.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p363.png">[363]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not set himself, however, to compose the Requiem straight through,
      but had thrown off different parts of it according to the mood he happened
      to be in. Thus before the Dies iræ was finished he had composed the
      Offertorium, of which the two movements, Domine Jesu Christe and Hostias,
      were left virtually complete in the same state as those mentioned above.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will now be understood how Mozart, going through the score, either at
      the piano or the desk with his pupil Süssmayr, would discuss the various
      points of the instrumentation, would encourage him to make suggestions,
      and explain his own ideas and intentions, so that Süssmayr would in many
      respects have formed a lively image in his mind of what the completed
      score would be, and would often be able faithfully to reproduce Mozart's
      own intentions. Of the remaining movements, Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus
      Dei, there were no such sketches in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Süssmayer's first care was to copy out all that Mozart had left imperfect,
      "that there might not be two handwritings together," as the widow wrote to
      André (Càcilia, VI., p. 202)&mdash;she must have had Eybler's promised
      completion in her mind&mdash;and then to fill in the instrumentation
      according to Mozart's apparent design. Pages 11-32 of Mozart's original
      manuscript, containing the Dies iræ as far as the Confutatis, fell into
      the hands of the Abbé Stadler, and were by him bequeathed to the Imperial
      Library in Vienna. The remaining sheets (33-45) containing the Lacrimosa,
      Domine, and Hostias, belonged to Eybler, who presented them to the same
      library. That Mozart had contemplated carrying them out, and uniting them
      into one score with the Requiem and Kyrie is proved by the continuous
      numbering of the pages in his own handwriting; there is no instance to be
      found of his having recopied a score so sketched out when filling it in.<a
      href="#linknote45-6" name="linknoteref45-6" id="linknoteref45-6"> 6 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p364.png">[364]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Süssmayr's appointed task, therefore, was the composition "from his own
      head" (ganz neu) of the concluding part of the Lacrimosa, the Sanctus,
      Benedictus, and Agnus Dei; only "in order to give the work more unity" he
      repeated the fugue of the Kyrie with the words "cum sanctis." The Requiem
      thus completed&mdash;the two first movements in Mozart's handwriting, the
      remainder in Süssmayr's&mdash;was delivered over to the owner.<a
      href="#linknote45-7" name="linknoteref45-7" id="linknoteref45-7"> 7 </a>
      If it was intended that the latter should accept the whole composition as
      by Mozart, appearances were certainly not calculated to undeceive him. The
      score in question passed in 1838 into the possession of the Imperial
      Library.<a href="#linknote45-8" name="linknoteref45-8" id="linknoteref45-8">
      8 </a> The first impression of every one who sees it, and who is familiar
      with Mozart's handwriting, must be that the whole of it was written by
      him, and that the autograph of Mozart's Requiem in its entirety is before
      him.<a href="#linknote45-9" name="linknoteref45-9" id="linknoteref45-9"> 9
      </a> Closer examination and comparison raise suspicion, many discrepancies
      are discovered, although perhaps only trifling ones, and the fact must be
      borne in mind that, to a question addressed to her on the subject,
      Mozart's widow answered (February 10, 1839) that a full score of the
      Requiem in Mozart's handwriting could not exist, since it was finished not
      by him but by Süssmayr.
    </p>
    <p>
      A comparison of the manuscript with several scores undoubtedly written by
      Süssmayr&mdash;a terzet and bass air, composed by him in 1793 for
      insertion in the "Serva Padrona"&mdash;solved the riddle. It was the same
      handwriting, closely resembling that of Mozart, with the same deviations
      from it which had been pointed out in the Requiem. There could <span
      class="side">SÜSSMAYR'S WORK.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p365.png">[365]</a></span> no longer be any doubt that
      Süssmayr had written the score from the Dies iræ&mdash;the paging begins
      afresh, starting with page 1 at the Sanctus. In one place the transcriber
      betrays himself by a mistake. The closing bars of the Tuba mirum are noted
      for the stringed instruments by Mozart, as follows:&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      In his copy Süssmayr has omitted the octave passage for the violins, and
      the characteristic instrumentation for the violas, and has filled up the
      omission in a way which is certainly no improvement on the original.<a
      href="#linknote45-10" name="linknoteref45-10" id="linknoteref45-10"> 10
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Süssmayr, it is clear, had so modelled his handwriting on that of Mozart
      that the two could only be distinguished by trifling idiosyncrasies. There
      are other instances of the same kind&mdash;Joh. Seb. Bach's second wife,
      for instance, writing a hand which only an expert could distinguish from
      her husband's, and Joachim's manuscript being, at one time at least,
      almost identical with Mendelssohn's. As far as the score of the Requiem
      was concerned, the wish to persuade the owner of the Requiem that he was
      possessed of a composition exclusively by Mozart may have come to the aid
      of <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p366.png">[366]</a></span> custom and natural aptitude.
      There is no doubt that Count Walsegg accepted the score as having been
      completed and written by Mozart at least as far as the Sanctus.<a
      href="#linknote45-11" name="linknoteref45-11" id="linknoteref45-11"> 11
      </a> Whether this was expressly stated, or merely taken for granted by
      him, does not appear, and the fact that the composition had been ordered
      by him with a view to a deception of another kind is a curious
      coincidence, but does not make the case any the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances it was to the interest of the widow to maintain
      that the Requiem had been completed by Mozart. This explains the assertion
      of Rochlitz<a href="#linknote45-12" name="linknoteref45-12"
      id="linknoteref45-12"> 12 </a> (who according to his own account had
      questioned Mozart's widow at Leipzig in 1796 concerning the whole story of
      the Requiem) that Mozart had completed the Requiem before his death.<a
      href="#linknote45-13" name="linknoteref45-13" id="linknoteref45-13"> 13
      </a> But a secret known to so many could hardly be long kept. The widow
      had retained a copy of the work, and a performance of it took place soon
      after in Jahn's Hall at Vienna, the hall being densely crowded. It was
      pretty well known to the performers what portions were by Mozart and what
      by Süssmayr,<a href="#linknote45-14" name="linknoteref45-14"
      id="linknoteref45-14"> 14 </a> and the knowledge was not slow to spread.
      It reached Munich<a href="#linknote45-15" name="linknoteref45-15"
      id="linknoteref45-15"> 15 </a> and Prague, where at the first performance
      of the Requiem no secret was made of the fact that the Sanctus was
      composed by Süssmayr.<a href="#linknote45-16" name="linknoteref45-16"
      id="linknoteref45-16"> 16 </a> The widow sold manuscript copies of the
      Requiem to various noblemen,<a href="#linknote45-17"
      name="linknoteref45-17" id="linknoteref45-17"> 17 </a> and allowed others
      to make copies of it;<a href="#linknote45-18" name="linknoteref45-18"
      id="linknoteref45-18"> 18 </a> Hiller copied the <span class="side">PUBLICATION.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p367.png">[367]</a></span> score
      note for note with his own hand, and wrote on the title-page "Opus,summum
      viri summi," expressing no doubt whatever as to the whole work being that
      of Mozart.<a href="#linknote45-19" name="linknoteref45-19"
      id="linknoteref45-19"> 19 </a> Not content with the profits thus accruing
      from the Requiem, the widow turned her attention towards its publication.
      The idea occurred to her that a public appeal to the Unknown might induce
      him to forego his claim on the composition.<a href="#linknote45-20"
      name="linknoteref45-20" id="linknoteref45-20"> 20 </a> The appeal,
      however, was not made, for the publishers, Breitkopf and Hàrtel, not
      conceiving themselves to be bound by the agreement made with Mozart,
      resolved on bringing out the work from the several transcripts of it which
      had fallen into their hands. Desirous, however, that the work should be
      produced with all possible correctness, they applied to the widow for her
      copy, with which, having no power to stop the publication, she saw no
      objection to furnishing them. To their question (prompted by the reports
      current as to the authorship of the work) whether the Requiem was wholly
      and solely composed by Mozart, she answered explicitly as follows (March
      27, 1799):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the Requiem, it is true that I possess the celebrated one, written
      shortly before his death. I know of no Requiem but this, and declare all
      others to be spurious.<a href="#linknote45-21" name="linknoteref45-21"
      id="linknoteref45-21"> 21 </a> How far it is his own composition&mdash;it
      is so to near the end&mdash;I will inform you when you receive it from me.
      The circumstances were as follows: Seeing his end approaching, he spoke
      with Herr Süssmayr, the present Imperial Kapellmeister, and requested him,
      if he should die without completing it, to repeat the first fugue in <span
      class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p368.png">[368]</a></span> the last part, as is customary;
      and told him also how he should develop the conclusion, of which the
      principal subjects were here and there already carried out in some of the
      parts. And this Herr Süssmayr actually did.
    </p>
    <p>
      On being pressed for further information she referred the publishers to
      Süssmayr himself, who answered in the letter already mentioned (February
      8, 1800). He nowhere asserts having received a decided commission from
      Mozart, nor does he mention the concluding fugue, so that it is plain that
      the widow turned her not very clear recollection of the transaction as far
      as possible in favour of the integrity of the Requiem. Count Walsegg, who
      had already given himself out as the composer of the Requiem, must have
      felt considerable annoyance at its wide dissemination as Mozart's work;
      but as yet he had made no sign. When however, in 1799, Breitkopf and
      Hàrtel announced the publication of the Requiem from the manuscript in the
      possession of Mozart's widow, he thought it time to put forward his claim.
      He sent his own copy of the score to his advocate, Dr. Sortschan, at
      Vienna, and through him demanded explanation and compensation from the
      widow. Stadler and Nissen negotiated with the advocate in her name.
      Stadler pointed out which parts had Mozart and which Süssmayr for their
      author, and the advocate wrote down all that he said for the information
      of the Count, to whom he returned his score.<a href="#linknote45-23"
      name="linknoteref45-23" id="linknoteref45-23"> 23 </a> As to compensation,
      the widow wrote to Hàrtel (January 30, 1800) that the Count had demanded
      the restitution of fifty ducats, but that he would perhaps be satisfied
      with receiving a number of copies of the work. Nissen at length induced
      the Count "with much difficulty and after many threats" to accept as
      payment transcripts of several unpublished compositions by Mozart,<a
      href="#linknote45-24" name="linknoteref45-24" id="linknoteref45-24"> 24
      </a> and even to allow the widow to revise the printed score by a
      comparison of it with his own.<a href="#linknote45-25"

    </p>
    <p>
      As the result of this unsatisfactory transaction to all concerned in it,
      we may conclude that the Requiem and Kyrie are the work of Mozart as we
      have them, that the movements from the Dies iræ to the first eight bars of
      the Lacrimosa, also the Domine Jesu and Hostias, were finished by Mozart
      in the voice part and the bass, and that the principal points of the
      instrumentation were also indicated by him, leaving only the details to be
      elaborated. This, however, is not by any means so easy and purely
      mechanical an undertaking as has been supposed, and Mozart's verbal
      suggestions must not be underrated. As regards the last three numbers,
      Süssmayr's statement that they had been "composed (verfertigt) entirely
      afresh" by him offers no decided testimony on the point. Stadler's account<a
      href="#linknote45-26" name="linknoteref45-26" id="linknoteref45-26"> 26
      </a> ("the widow told me that after Mozart's death a few scraps of paper
      with music on them had been found on his writing-desk, and had been handed
      over to Herr Süssmayr; what they contained, or what use Süssmayr made of
      them, I do not know") admits the possibility, but only the possibility,
      that these scraps were sketches for the last movements.<a
      href="#linknote45-27" name="linknoteref45-27" id="linknoteref45-27"> 27
      </a> The repeatedly expressed doubt as to whether "these flowers really
      grew in Süssmayr's garden" can only be supported upon internal evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious spirit in which Mozart undertook the composition of his
      Requiem, the intensity of his absorption in it, and the artistic labour
      which he bestowed upon it, are best evidenced by the work itself.<a
      href="#linknote45-28" name="linknoteref45-28" id="linknoteref45-28"> 28
      </a> It is remarkable that towards the close of his life, when increasing
      illness disposed his mind to serious reflection, his musical labours
      should have been calculated to turn his thoughts upon death and the grave.
      On the one hand his views as a Freemason, which were both earnest and
      sincere, found their expression in the "Zauberflote"; and, on the other,
      his religious convictions <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p370.png">[370]</a></span> asserted for
      the last time in the Requiem the sway over his mind and conscience which
      they had never lost.<a href="#linknote45-29" name="linknoteref45-29"
      id="linknoteref45-29"> 29 </a> The two sets of mental activities thus
      roused found their common centre in Mozart's mind, and impelled him to the
      production of his most powerful and most important works. The similarity
      of thought and tendency displayed in the Requiem and the "Zauberflöte" is
      observable even in the combinations of external means in corresponding
      parts of the two works. The combination of basset-horns, bassoons, and
      trombones, and here and there of trumpets and drums, with the stringed
      instruments, which gave so singular an expression of earnest solemnity to
      the tone-colouring of the "Zauberflöte," is made use of again in the
      Requiem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tone-blending of the latter work is nevertheless limited, the
      clearer wind instruments&mdash;flutes, oboes, clarinets and the softer
      horns&mdash;being left out altogether, and the frequent orchestral
      characterisation depending altogether upon the varied combinations of the
      instruments named above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The view upheld in the opera that serious ideas must be expressed in
      corresponding severity of form is even more decided in the Requiem, in so
      far as Mozart must have regarded as natural and inevitable the
      identification of certain fixed forms with the musical expression of
      religious emotion in an act of worship. The praiseworthy feeling which
      leads an artist, who believes himself to be offering his work for the
      service of the Most High, to bestow his best thoughts and his best
      workmanship upon it, cannot fail also to have influenced him. The pleasure
      which, after his study of Handel's oratorios and the strong impression
      made on him by Bach's motetts, Mozart took in the severely contrapuntal
      style of composition is evinced both in the "Zauberflöte" and in the two
      organ pieces composed in December, 1790, and March, 1791. But the main
      inducement to this form was doubtless the facility with which it expressed
      a serious, controlled and concentrated frame of mind, allowing at the same
      <span class="side">KYRIE&mdash;INTROITUS.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p371.png">[371]</a></span> time much freedom of
      characteristic and individual expression. The chief significance of the
      Requiem rests herein, that it proves these forms, with their fixed laws
      and strongly marked features, to have more than a merely abstract or
      historical value; it proves them to be in fact, when artistically
      conceived and scientifically handled, capable of giving appropriate
      expression to the deepest emotion in which the human heart finds vent.<a
      href="#linknote45-30" name="linknoteref45-30" id="linknoteref45-30"> 30
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      In considering the Requiem, a distinction must be made between the
      different parts of this kind of Mass and the different degrees of
      importance which they receive in relation to the act of worship with which
      they are associated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kyrie is preceded by the Introitus, beginning with a prayer for the
      departed. The bassoons and basset-horns, in successive imitation, give
      utterance to the soft, sustained melody of the prayer, supported by a
      simple accompaniment on the stringed instruments; it is interrupted by
      four clashing trumpet chords announcing the approach of judgment, and not
      again recurring until the day of doom is there. Thereupon the voices
      immediately enter, falling in from the bass upwards; but a syncopated
      figure for the violins gives the petition for repose an expression of
      painful unrest, called forth by the contemplation of death and the coming
      judgment; soon, however, the clouds are pierced by the divine light which
      is finally to disperse them, and the movement comes to a peaceful end
      after an outburst of confidence and strength rendered by the orchestra.
      After a short transition passage come the words of the psalm, "Lord, we
      will magnify Thee upon Zion, and pay our vows unto the Most High." In
      order to emphasise these as the words of Scripture, Mozart has set them to
      an old chorale melody and given them to a soprano voice, which utters them
      in clear, pure tones, like consolation from above. The chorale, as has
      been already remarked (Vol. I., p. 200), is the two-part <i>tropus</i> of
      the ninth church mode to the psalm "In exitu Israel de Ægypto," and had
      previously been made use of by Mozart as a Cantus firmus <span class="side">THE
      REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p372.png">[372]</a></span>
      in his "Betulia Liberata"; but what a difference between the work of the
      youth and that of the matured master!<a href="#linknote45-31"
      name="linknoteref45-31" id="linknoteref45-31"> 31 </a> While the soprano
      chorus takes up the same melody firmly and forcibly with the words "Thou
      that hearest prayer, unto Thee shall all flesh come!" the other voices
      fall in in animated movement, and an energetic figure for the violins
      increases the force of the expression. Then the petition for eternal rest
      is renewed with a stronger expression of confidence, but still with the
      ground-tone of painful agitation, rendered, by the union with the first
      motif of a second, more animated and more forcible. This second subject
      has already been hinted at in the transition passage to the psalm texts,
      from which also the passage accompanying the texts is taken, and here
      first fully asserts itself, the psychological development thus coinciding
      with the musical climax. The climax reaches its highest point in the
      petition for eternal light, which the divided voices utter alternately and
      repeat in concert with tender, pleading supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ejaculations "Kyrie eleison!" and "Christe eleison!" are bound
      together as the two themes of a double fugue (the first strong and firm,
      the second agitated and impulsive), which are carried out together in
      inextricable entanglement&mdash;their expression heightened by the
      chromatic construction towards the close, until in constantly increasing
      climax they come to a pause on a harshly dissonant chord, and then, as it
      were, collect themselves and unite in quiet composure. This fugue<a
      href="#linknote45-32" name="linknoteref45-32" id="linknoteref45-32"> 32

      </a> Whether the treatment of the keys adopted in this movement is in
      accordance with the requirements of a strict fugue, must be decided by the
      masters of the school; it is undeniable that on it depends the character
      and effect of the movement, and that the essential laws of counterpoint
      are here apprehended and turned to account with deep insight into their
      true nature.<a href="#linknote45-36" name="linknoteref45-36"

      The execution of the chromatic passages is difficult certainly; but, apart
      from the fact that both older and contemporary masters, who wrote for
      trained choirs&mdash;Bach, for instance, or Handel, or Haydn&mdash;made
      similar demands on the skill of their performers, they are perfectly
      possible if taken in the right time, and the effect produced by them is
      probably that which Mozart intended. The conception of the movement is
      clearly expressed, and requires neither explanation nor apology.<a
      href="#linknote45-37" name="linknoteref45-37" id="linknoteref45-37"> 37
      </a> The exclamation, "Lord, have mercy upon us!" is capable of very
      varied expression; in the mouth of one in the agony of death, burdened
      with sin and about to appear before the Judge of all men, it becomes an
      agonising appeal for mercy. This state of mind has already been expressed,
      and rises at the close of the Requiem into such an intensity of longing
      after eternal light, that the anguished yet not despairing cry of the
      Kyrie is perfectly naturally led up to. The two feelings are expressed in
      the two themes of the fugue, although, in accordance with the character of
      the <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p374.png">[374]</a></span> Mass, even the confidence is
      penetrated with a feeling of grief. In such a mood the element of
      agitation naturally rises higher and higher, until at length the anguish
      of suspense finds vent in the heartrending cry for mercy which leads to
      composure and resignation. The two movements of the Requiem and the Kyrie
      are thus formed into a whole of perfect harmonic unity, and lead the way
      to the Dies iræ.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of this unmistakable unity of conception and construction it
      appears strange that decided traces of Handel's influence should appear in
      the principal subjects. Stadler remarks that Mozart has borrowed the motif
      of the Requiem from the first motif of Handel's "Dirge on the death of
      Queen Caroline"&mdash;"as some loose sheets among his retrains show"&mdash;and
      has worked it out after his own manner.<a href="#linknote45-38"
      name="linknoteref45-38" id="linknoteref45-38"> 38 </a> This can only
      allude to the preliminary sketches of this portion of the Requiem such as
      Mozart was accustomed to make for contrapuntal work before writing the
      score (Vol. II., p. 433), and of such there must have been a great number
      during the composition of his Requiem. Stadler's conjecture that they were
      vestiges of Mozart's youthful studies is unfounded; he was not acquainted
      with Handel's works in his youth, nor until they were introduced to him by
      Van Swieten (Vol. II., p. 386), under whose direction he rearranged
      Handel's oratorios between 1788-1790 (p. 218). Before this, the anthem in
      question cannot have been known to him. In this beautiful work, composed
      in December, 1737,<a href="#linknote45-39" name="linknoteref45-39"
      id="linknoteref45-39"> 39 </a> Handel has taken the Chorale, "Herr Jesu
      Christ, du wahres Gut," or, "Wenn mein Stündlein vorhanden ist',<a
      href="#linknote45-40" name="linknoteref45-40" id="linknoteref45-40"> 40
      </a> as Cantus firmus to the first chorus, and has made further use of the
      same theme in the fugued concluding chorus. It is very unlikely that
      Mozart deliberately chose out the subject in order to work it out in a
      different way to Handel; it was more probably so stamped on his memory as
      to have suggested itself naturally as suited to the words before him, and
      to have then <span class="side">HANDEL'S INFLUENCE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p375.png">[375]</a></span> been quite
      independently worked out by him. Stadler also points out that Mozart has
      taken the motif to the Kyrie from one of Handel's oratorios. The chorus
      "Halleluja! we will rejoice in Thy salvation." from Handel's "Joseph,"
      contains both the themes of Mozart's Kyrie, but in the major key; again,
      the principal subject of the Kyrie eleison has been carried out as a fugue
      in the minor in the well-known and beautiful chorus of the Messiah, "By
      His stripes." A comparison of this fugue with that of the Requiem, shows
      that the adaptation has not merely consisted in the change from a major to
      a minor key, and that the actual motif, a very favourable one for
      treatment in counterpoint&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      and one constantly occurring in the fugal movements of every age, here
      serves only as a nucleus from which the master proceeds to develop his own
      independent creation. The essential principle in the construction of a
      double fugue is the combination of two themes, each bearing a necessary
      relation to the other. In the chorus in "Joseph" are two motifs exactly
      answering to each other; and it can scarcely be doubted that Mozart was
      struck with the combination and adopted it, although, as the examples
      adduced will show, his working-out of the motifs is essentially his own.
      Handel only really worked out the second motif&mdash;one, by the way,
      which often recurs in others of his works&mdash;and this in very free
      treatment; the first only occasionally emerges from the passages which
      play around it, like a huge rock almost overwhelmed by the billows. Mozart
      has undertaken such a fugal elaboration of both motifs as presupposes a
      radically different treatment impossible without a new intellectual
      conception of the task before him. Still more essential does this
      reconception appear when it is remembered that the supplication of a
      sinner for mercy was to take the place of a joyful offering of praise and
      thanksgiving. The transposition to a minor key involves at the outset so
      complete a reconstruction of the harmonic treatment as to point to a new
      creation <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p376.png">[376]</a></span> rather than an adaptation. We
      here stand in the presence of one of the mysteries of music; how it is
      that one and the same musical idea, embodied in one definite form, should
      be capable by means of artistic arrangement of expressing different and
      even totally opposite emotions. It is true, doubtless, that invention is
      the characteristic gift of genius, but absolute novelty is not to be
      considered as altogether indispensable to invention. In music, as in every
      other art, the creation of an individual becomes common property for his
      successors, whose task it is so to develop and carry it on as in their
      turn to create and construct an original and undying work. Richly endowed
      natures, in the consciousness of their power of producing what is
      perfectly original from?any given point, often undisguisedly follow the
      impulse given by a predecessor to their imagination. A striking proof of
      this is given by Haydn, who has written a double fugue as the last
      movement of his Quartet in F minor, which might appear a deliberate
      attempt at rivalry, but which has in reality every claim to independence.
      To what extent Handel himself has employed, retouched, and re-elaborated
      melodies, not only of previous occurrence in his own works, but borrowed
      from other musicians, has lately been pointed out by Chrysander; and one
      of the most striking examples of such musical plagiarism is Gluck's
      expressive air from "Iphigenie in Tauris," "Je t'implore, et je tremble,"
      which was unmistakably suggested by the beautiful Gigue in Seb. Bach's
      Clavier Studies (I., part I.).<a href="#linknote45-41"
      name="linknoteref45-41" id="linknoteref45-41"> 41 </a> Neither of these
      two great masters could be suspected of borrowing ideas for lack of

    <p>
      A curious part of the Requiem, of special prominence in the musical
      construction of the Mass, is the old Latin hymn, <span class="side">DIES
      IRÆ.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p377.png">[377]</a></span>
      Dies iræ, which is generally not quite accurately described as a Sequence.<a
      href="#linknote45-43" name="linknoteref45-43" id="linknoteref45-43"> 43
      </a> It had grown into a custom in the service of the Mass that at the
      Alleluja of the Gradual in High Mass, which was repeated by the
      congregation, and then again by the choir, the last syllable "ja" should
      be extended into a jubilus, upon which long-drawn-out florid progressions
      (<i>sequentæ</i>) were sung, of different forms for different festivals.
      Gradually these became so elaborate as to offer great difficulties in
      execution and to require special practice, and the idea arose of providing
      these merely vocalised melodies (<i>neumæ</i>, or divisions) with words
      which were called <i>prosæ</i>, because they were confined to no
      particular metre or rhythm, but followed the melody, a syllable to every
      note. The greatest development of these <i>prosæ</i>, which were now
      called <i>sequentiæ</i>, was made in the ninth century by Notker the
      Stammerer for his scholars and successors in the musical school of St.
      Gall.<a href="#linknote45-44" name="linknoteref45-44" id="linknoteref45-44">
      44 </a> If he did not actually invent them, he gave them their essential
      form. Proceeding from the old alleluja jubilation, he founded upon it a
      fixed form, consisting partly in regularly recurring cadences, partly in
      the twofold repetition of each melodic progression, with the frequent
      employment of a kind of refrain. This gave to the words a certain amount
      of regularity, still however far from any strictness of rhythm or metre.
      These Sequences introduced a fresh element of animated movement into the
      rigid uniformity of the ritual, and, coming in the place of the responses,
      gave the congregation an effective share in the service. They had
      therefore a reciprocal effect on the national poetry, and were developed
      side by side with it. In process of time rhyme, at first only occasionally
      appearing, became general. The two lines set to the corresponding melodic
      choral progressions were connected by rhyme, as well as the lines of the
      refrain. Then they were united into <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p378.png">[378]</a></span> verses,
      and gradually the number of syllables in each line was made equal. The
      Sequences, which allowed of very great variety of form, were extremely
      popular in Germany, France, and England&mdash;less so in Italy; and so
      many were written, often set to well-known melodies, that they seemed to
      imperil the strictly conventional character of the Mass. The Church
      therefore forbade the use of all but three&mdash;"Victimæ Paschali,"
      "Veni, sancte Spiritus," and "Lauda Sion salvatorem"&mdash;which alone are
      included in the revised Breviary after the Council of Trent in 1568.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be no Sequence properly so-called in a Requiem, because there is
      no Alleluja to which it can serve as the supplement; but, following the
      analogy of the Sequence, a hymn on the last judgment was added to the
      Tractus, which follows the Gradual, as a preparation for the reading of
      the Gospel. The date of the introduction of this hymn is uncertain, but it
      is mentioned as an integral portion of the Requiem by Barthol. Albizzi in
      1385, and was acknowledged and retained as such, together with the three
      Sequences named above. The author of the hymn is not certainly identified,
      but it was most probably the Franciscan Thomas, of Celano, who was living
      in 1255.<a href="#linknote45-45" name="linknoteref45-45"
      id="linknoteref45-45"> 45 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The importance of the Dies iræ from a musical point of view is determined
      by the fact that it takes the place of the Gloria and the Credo, which are
      not sung in the Requiem. Instead of the joyful confidence of these
      movements, the reflections of sinful man in the presence of judgment here
      find their expression, and this obviously determines the tone of the
      whole. The euphonious force and beauty of the hymn, which have not been
      attained in any of the numerous translations made of it, distinguish it as
      made for music,<a href="#linknote45-46" name="linknoteref45-46"
      id="linknoteref45-46"> 46 </a> the subject being also very favourable to
      composition. With graphic force the terrors of judgment are painted with
      all ecclesiastical severity, and with constant reference to the actual
      words of Scripture, while the mercy and <span class="side">DIES IRÆ.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p379.png">[379]</a></span>
      loving-kindness of the Redeemer are dwelt on with equal emphasis. The fear
      of damnation is tempered by the hope of salvation, and from the waitings
      of remorse rises the prayer of the trusting believer. Intense and varied
      emotions are thrown into relief by strong contrast. Brief but pregnant
      suggestions give occasion for powerful musical characterisation, favoured
      also by the isolated position of the hymn in the service. Just as the
      preacher addresses his solemn warning to the congregation with more of
      individual emphasis than the priest who offers the sacrifice of the Mass,
      so the composer who depicts the terrors of the last judgment, so as to
      bring them home to the imagination of his hearers, has freer individual
      scope than if he were merely following the different acts of worship. In
      the Dies iræ, therefore, we have a freer style, a more vivid expression
      than elsewhere. Nor is it so bound by the usages of tradition as the other
      parts of the Mass, although a division of the hymn into particular
      sections is indicated by the arrangement of the subject, and necessitated
      by the conditions of musical construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hymn begins by representing the destruction of the world, which is to
      precede the coming of the Lord, and the expression must therefore be
      forcible and animated even to excess. Here, then, for the first time the
      chorus enters as a compact mass, only dividing once, when the basses
      exclaim: "Quantus tremor est futurus!" the only attempt at tone-painting,
      while the other voices wail: "Dies iræ! dies illa!" until they all unite
      to express the fearful majesty in which the Judge shall appear. The effect
      of this chorus in contrast to what has gone before rests in great measure
      on the high position of the voices; their shrill, clear tone, heightened
      by the string accompaniment of semiquavers or syncopated notes, is
      expressive of strong agitation. Without having recourse to any new devices&mdash;trombones
      are omitted here that the shrill effect may not be impaired&mdash;an
      altered tone-colouring transports the hearer to an altogether new region
      of ideas. The harmonising adds to the effect by the occurrence of harsh,
      rugged chords&mdash;especially by the transition from E major to C minor
      at the repetition of the "Quantus <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p380.png">[380]</a></span> tremor"
      and the return to A major; not to mention other striking features, such as
      the imitative passage for the tenor at the first "Quantus tremor," which
      expresses amazement in the most vivid manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      After bringing before the mind of the hearers the tumult and horror of the
      destruction of the world, the judgment begins&mdash;the trumpets call all
      created beings before the throne of the Judge. A tenor trumpet makes the
      announcement in a simple passage, which is taken up by a bass voice, and
      the two unite with a solemn and dignified effect.<a href="#linknote45-47"
      name="linknoteref45-47" id="linknoteref45-47"> 47 </a> Then one after
      another a tenor, alto, and soprano voice describe the judgment and its
      unmitigated severity, and at last combine in trembling supplication at the
      words, "Cum vix iustus sit securus." Mozart has here, apparently,
      intentionally refrained from emphasising the terrors of judgment, wishing
      to heighten the contrast of the destruction of the world with the
      appearance of the Judge, and its effect on the conscience as well as the
      senses of mankind; he aimed at expressing this effect by means of a
      soul-elevating calm; but he has fallen short of his endeavours. The
      movement is in itself expressive, dignified, and full of euphonious
      beauty, especially towards the close, but it fails to rouse in us a sense
      of the grandeur and elevation which belong to the subject.<a
      href="#linknote45-48" name="linknoteref45-48" id="linknoteref45-48"> 48
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that no created being is justified before God recalls the
      conception of the Judge throned in His awful glory, which is expressed
      with terrible force in the chorus that follows. The plan of it shows
      clearly the influence of the words on the musical conception. The
      thrice-repeated exclamation "Rex!" and then "Rex tremendæ majestatis,"
      makes, even when spoken, a strong impression, but when sung by the whole
      strength of the chorus in simple, powerful chords, supported by the wind
      instruments, the effect is almost overpowering, and is heightened by the
      strongly <span class="side">DIES IRÆ.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p381.png">[381]</a></span> punctuated passage for the
      strings, sinking, as it were; into terrified silence at each recurrence of
      the exclamation. The idea of the mercy of the Redeemer is at first
      subordinate to this impression: while sopranos and altos in strict
      imitation repeat the "Rex tremendae majestatis," and the stringed
      instruments elaborate their figure in two-part imitation, the tenors and
      basses announce "Qui salvandos salvas gratis" with a characteristic motif,
      also in strict imitation; and this is repeated, with alternations of the
      upper and lower parts, until they all four unite in the whole sentence,
      forming a movement of concisest strength and severity. The declaration of
      mercy calls forth the prayer, beginning with the single appeal, "Salva
      me!" repeated to the gradually dying passage for the stringed instruments,
      and finally concentrating all its strength and intensity of emotion in the
      prayer:<a href="#linknote45-49" name="linknoteref45-49"
      id="linknoteref45-49"> 49 </a> "Salva me, Fons pietatis!"<a
      href="#linknote45-50" name="linknoteref45-50" id="linknoteref45-50"> 50
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the idea gains ground of the merciful Saviour and His work in
      reconciling mankind with God; Him we beseech to intercede for souls
      conscious of their sinfulness. The verses which are devoted to this
      division of the subject are given to a quartet of solo voices, as
      appropriate to the gentler and more individual tone of the emotions
      depicted. The quartet in question is one of the longest and most elaborate
      movements of the Requiem, and in its plan and arrangement, in the wealth
      and importance of its different motifs, in the delicacy of its detail, and
      the spirit which breathes from it throughout, it is perhaps the finest of
      them all; nor is it too much to say that no more beautiful and noble piece
      of music of the kind has ever been written. Mozart himself recognised the
      fact, telling his wife, after writing down the Recorders, that if he were
      to die before finishing the Requiem it was of the greatest importance that
      <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p382.png">[382]</a></span> this movement should have been
      completed.<a href="#linknote45-51" name="linknoteref45-51"
      id="linknoteref45-51"> 51 </a> The chief part of the movement, after its
      introduction by the ritornello, is formed by a motif given by two voices
      in imitation at the beginning, the middle, and again towards the close,
      the fervent expression of which is tinged with severity by means of
      suspensions of the second. It is supported by a figured bass, the first
      bar of which&mdash;[See Page Image]
    </p>
    <p>
      contains the germ from which most of the motifs of the accompaniment and
      the interludes are developed, and finally winds up the ritornello in
      two-part canonic imitation on the violins, with a figure for the violas in
      counter-movement to an organ point on the bass. This two-part movement
      having been executed first by the alto and bass, then by the soprano and
      tenor, the four unite in free movement to bring the whole to an expressive
      close with the supplicating appeal, "Ne me perdas illa die!" In the first
      episode the parts are at first divided into short responding phrases, held
      together by the figured bass, and coming to a close together, whereupon
      the first movement, abbreviated, is repeated. Then there occurs a new
      motif of essentially harmonic character, the effect of which depends upon
      the thrice-heightened climax of the chords, intensified by the contrast of
      the high and low voices. Then the parts divide again and lead the way for
      the last entry of the first movement, which is repeated with a short
      parenthesis inserted; the final close is brought about in a very
      interesting and satisfying manner by the fine successive or parallel
      motion of the different parts. But we despair of reproducing in words
      anything but a mere skeleton of the beauty of this wonderful quartet&mdash;a
      beauty whose peculiar charm consists in the union of loveliest grace with
      chaste severity and earnest depth of thought. This charm it owes to the
      simplicity and truth of feeling which led the master to seek and to find
      the best expression <span class="side">DIES IRÆ.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p383.png">[383]</a></span> for what was
      in his mind; and never in any art, be it what it may, has the comforting
      feeling of pious trust in the mercy of God, arising from the consciousness
      of human weakness, been more truly and beautifully expressed than in this
      Recordare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The verse which follows contrasts the torments of the damned with the
      hopes of believers, and could not therefore be suitably rendered with the
      same composure of tone. It had become customary to emphasise the contrast
      very strongly, depicting the torments of hell as graphically as the joys
      of Paradise. In this movement, therefore, the men's voices are opposed to
      the women's, and describe the torments in short, imitative phrases,
      emphasised when repeated by rapid changes from major to minor and sharp
      suspensions and rendered still more forcible by a frequent pregnant
      rhythmical figure borne by the stringed instruments in unison. The women's
      voices, supported only by a quiet violin passage, express a low and
      fervent appeal for redemption, intensified upon repetition by some
      suspensions.<a href="#linknote45-52" name="linknoteref45-52"
      id="linknoteref45-52"> 52 </a> All the emotions and reflections
      represented so far have tended to turn the thoughts inwards, with such
      feelings of remorse and repentance as alone can lead to the trust in
      divine mercy, and it is with the feeling of deep self-abasement that the
      supremest point of the hymn is approached. The voices unite soft and low
      in a succession of harmonies such as no mortal ear had ever heard:&mdash;[See

      Involuntarily we bow before the declaration of a mystery which no mouth
      may utter; irresistibly impelled by the stream of harmony, we feel our
      spirits loosed from the bondage which has held them, and born again to
      life and light; we feel a breath of the immortality which had already
      touched the brow of the master as he wrote. To the contrite and broken
      spirit the Day of Wrath becomes a day of mourning, and so the "Lacrimosa
      dies illa" begins with a gentle plaint hushed by the terrifying
      representation of the rising of the dead from their graves, which is
      grandly expressed in a powerful crescendo, brought about by the rising
      climax of the melody and the onward motion of the harmonies. With the
      anguished cry of "Homo reus!" the pen dropped from the hand of the master;
      the emotion which shook his whole being was too strong for expression:
      "Huic ergo parce Deus, pie Jesu Domine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      How far Süssmayr's continuation has fulfilled Mozart's intentions cannot
      of course be absolutely decided; he has rightly taken up and carried out
      the suggestion of the first few bars, and his conclusion has an imposing
      solemnity. It is worthy of note that henceforward the trombones are much
      more frequently employed than heretofore. When we compare the scanty and
      peculiar use made of them in the Requiem and the Tuba mirum, with their
      characteristic occurrence in the "Zauberflote," it appears doubtful
      whether Mozart himself would so often have introduced them as supports to
      the voices; although this was no doubt the custom in contemporary church
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Offertorium belongs again to the service, and requires on that account
      another and a more conventional character in the music than the Dies iræ.
      It falls into two sections, of which the first (Domine Jesu Christe)
      prefers the petition that the soul of the departed may not go down into
      hell, but <span class="side">OFFERTORIUM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p385.png">[385]</a></span> may be carried into light by the
      Archangel Michael. The earnest and affecting character of the music is
      tinged with a certain amount of harshness and unrest, arising from the
      constant recurrence of the mention of hell and its torments, which
      distinguishes the movement from the otherwise similar one of the Requiem.
      The vivid contrasts of the words are accentuated by the music, and the
      result is a succession of short phrases, combining into larger groups,
      which correspond with each other. The words "ne absorbeat eas Tartarus"
      are worked out into a short fugue, which has an unusually harsh effect
      owing to the characteristic sevenths of the theme and the powerful
      semiquaver passage carried out by the stringed instruments in unison. The
      gentle melody, supported by the solo voices in canonic imitation, "sed
      sanctus signifer Michael," has, on the contrary, a soothing effect, and is
      the only ray of light which is allowed to shine through the surrounding
      gloom. The whole movement closes with the words "Quam (lucem sanctam) olim
      Abrahæ promisisti" in an elaborate fugue, the effect of which is
      heightened by the accompaniment which carries out a motif of its own in
      close imitation. G. Weber found fault with this fugue, with its aimless
      elaboration of a subordinate idea and superfluous repetition of the same
      unimportant words;<a href="#linknote45-53" name="linknoteref45-53"
      id="linknoteref45-53"> 53 </a> and Seyfried defended it on the ground that
      a fugue was considered indispensable at this point,<a href="#linknote45-54"
      name="linknoteref45-54" id="linknoteref45-54"> 54 </a> and indeed was not
      unsuited to it. The idea is, in truth, not a subordinate one, it is the
      ground of the confidence with which the prayer is offered, and so becomes
      the basis of the whole movement. The fugue is the form best fitted for
      short, pithy sentences, and the one in question has the same singular
      mixture of trust in the divine mercy and tortured anxiety at the thought
      of death which was expressed in the first movement of the Requiem,
      although it there assumed a milder form. Separate passages are of great,
      though somewhat rugged beauty, as befitted the movement; more especially
      the closing passage, "de profundo lacu, in obscurum, et semini eius."

      The second part (Hostias et preces) has a much more composed character, as
      becomes the offering by the spirit of its sacrifice to the Almighty. The
      idea, therefore, of still lingering disquiet is left to be expressed by
      the syncopated passage for the violins, the voices going together almost
      throughout the movement, and declaiming the words with strikingly
      appropriate expression. The very simplicity of this movement reveals the
      hand of the master, and gives it an individuality especially noticeable at
      the words "tu suscipe pro animabus illis, quarum hodie memoriam facimus."
      Thus far a reference to Mozart's own manuscript suffices to determine how
      much was left to Süssmayr's carrying out. Although sufficient indications
      were given even of the more elaborate and independent instrumental parts
      to serve as a guide to a well-educated musician, yet the example adduced
      above shows how much freedom in matters of detail was left for the further
      elaboration; and, not to mention various oversights, it is probable that
      had Mozart completed the composition many delicate touches would have been
      added to the accompanying parts which cannot now be even conjectured. Very
      few indications are given for the wind instruments, and even if Mozart
      gave verbal instructions concerning them, much must still remain in doubt.
      It must be allowed, however, that Süssmayr's share in the work has been on
      the whole successfully performed; it is quite in keeping with the rest,
      and he has plainly refrained from making any alterations or surreptitious
      interpolations. With the last three movements we enter the domain of
      conjecture, if we are to reject the positive testimony of Süssmayr,
      supported by Mozart's widow, as to the share of the former in the work.
      Rochlitz, reviewing Süssmayr's letter on the subject, remarks that "the
      works already known to be by Herr Süssmayr subject his claim to an
      important share in this great composition to considerable doubt";<a
      href="#linknote45-55" name="linknoteref45-55" id="linknoteref45-55"> 55
      </a> and he expressed his suspicions more decidedly at a later time.<a

      </a> G. Weber, who failed to recognise Mozart in many <span class="side">SÜSSMAYR'S

      parts of the first movements, has, on the contrary, assigned to him a
      distinct share in the last movements.<a href="#linknote45-57"
      name="linknoteref45-57" id="linknoteref45-57"> 57 </a> Marx emphatically

      name="linknoteref45-58" id="linknoteref45-58"> 58 </a> This view is
      founded on the assumption that the movements are worthy of Mozart, and are
      such as Süssmayr himself could not have produced; but the critic must be
      careful not to bring forward on aesthetic grounds alone accusations which
      involve so much of grave moral delinquency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seyfried's assertion that,<a href="#linknote45-59" name="linknoteref45-59"
      id="linknoteref45-59"> 59 </a> according to the generally accepted opinion
      in Vienna, Süssmayr found note-books containing sketches of these
      movements, and showing Mozart's intention of elaborating the Osanna fugue
      after the Benedictus, as well as the new theme for the concluding fugue,
      Cum sanctis, has scarcely been investigated with the care which it
      demands. One circumstance has, as far as I know, been left altogether out
      of account. If the last three movements had been altogether wanting at
      Mozart's death, it would have appeared, one would think, both easier and
      simpler to supply them from one of his manuscript Masses, which were
      entirely unknown, than to commission Süssmayr to write them afresh; and
      such a proceeding would doubtless have been far more capable of
      justification to the owner of the work. But the confusion and
      embarrassment in which Mozart's death threw his widow and her affairs may
      have occasioned many things to be done which would not otherwise have
      taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frz. Xav. Süssmayr, who, as a young man of twenty-seven, enjoyed the
      friendship of Salieri<a href="#linknote45-60" name="linknoteref45-60"
      id="linknoteref45-60"> 60 </a> and Mozart, became so intimate with the
      latter<a href="#linknote45-61" name="linknoteref45-61"
      id="linknoteref45-61"> 61 </a> that he was, as Seyfried <span class="side">THE
      REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p388.png">[388]</a></span>
      expresses it, "the inseparable companion of the immortal Amphion." He
      adopted Mozart's style of writing with such success that, although his
      ideas often fell far short of his master's, many of his works in the
      serious style might, Seyfred maintains, be taken for Mozart's, did we not
      know that they were Süssmayr's;<a href="#linknote45-62"
      name="linknoteref45-62" id="linknoteref45-62"> 62 </a> Hauptmann has
      informed me of instrumental works by him which show quite Mozart's manner
      of work, and might pass for lighter compositions by the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sievers, who warmly espoused Süssmayr's cause, speaks of his "Spiegel von
      Arkadien," which he ranks with the "Zauberflote,"
    </p>
    <p>
      and of various pieces which may serve as models of the graceful and
      characteristic as well as of the tragico-serio styles of composition.<a
      href="#linknote45-63" name="linknoteref45-63" id="linknoteref45-63"> 63
      </a> I have carefully examined his operas, "Der Spiegel von Arkadien"
      (1794) and "Soliman II." (1800), as well as some of his lighter church
      compositions, and find nothing in them beyond an easy but superficial
      inventive power, a smooth practised workmanship, and almost throughout an
      obvious imitation of Mozart's manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanctus and Osanna are scarcely of a kind to admit of a decided
      opinion as to their authorship. The brevity and conciseness of the Sanctus
      do not by any means prove it not to have been by Mozart, for all the
      movements of the Requiem, when not lengthened by a fugal treatment, are
      similarly compressed. Nor must an unpleasing progression for the violins
      be taken as decisive against his authorship, for the working-out is in any
      case not his. On the other hand, it must not be concluded that because the
      movement has a general character of dignified grandeur, and the
      commencement of the Pleni sunt is truly majestic, that therefore Süssmayr
      could not have written it. It is not on the whole equal to the best of the
      preceding movements. The short fugue of the Osanna is animated, vigorous,
      and faultlessly concise; there is nothing against the supposition that
      Mozart might have written it; but, on the other hand, it would be
      difficult to prove with certainty that it might not have been <span
      class="side">SÜSSMAYR'S SHARE IN THE WORK.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p389.png">[389]</a></span> the work of a musician with the
      amount of talent and cultivation unquestionably possessed by Süssmayr.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case is somewhat different with the Benedictus, where, according to
      custom, solo voices are introduced in a long and elaborate quartet of
      pleasing character. Zelter says of it: "The Benedictus is as excellent as
      it can be, but the school decides against it being by Mozart. Süssmayr
      knew Mozart's school of music, but had not been trained in it from early
      youth, and indications of this may be found here and there in the
      beautiful Benedictus."<a href="#linknote45-64" name="linknoteref45-64"
      id="linknoteref45-64"> 64 </a> He is doubtless right. The first motif for
      the alto, and the idea of making the several voices reply to each other,
      might very well be Mozart's; but certainly not the working-out. The motion
      is obviously interrupted when the soprano, after the alto, again enters in
      the tonic; and the passage into the dominant is very lame. Still lamer,
      after the conclusion of the first part, are the laborious continuance in F
      major, and (instead of the development naturally expected here) the
      immediate return by the chord of the seventh to the first part, which is
      then repeated in its entirety. Neither the design nor the execution is
      worthy of Mozart; nor is it credible that in the interlude he would have
      copied the "et lux perpetua" from the Requiem in such a strange fashion as
      it has here been done, without any reason for an allusion to that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The abnormally thick and full instrumentation must also be taken into
      consideration. The instrumentation has, it is true, not been worked out by
      Mozart in the other movements, but here it can scarcely be separated from
      the general design, and it is distinguished from that of all the other
      movements by the use of two trombones, which Mozart never employed
      elsewhere, and which here supply the place of horns. Finally, the
      character of the movement is in many passages soft and effeminate,
      contrasting in this respect with the earnestness of the other movements,
      even of the Tuba mirum.<a href="#linknote45-65" name="linknoteref45-65"

    </p>
    <p>
      Osanna is, according to custom, an exact repetition of the previous one,
      only that the voices are transposed on account of the altered key.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Agnus Dei transports us to quite a different region. Here we find the
      depth and intensity of feeling, the noble beauty and the originality of
      invention, which we admire in the first movements of the Requiem. The fine
      expressive violin figure of the first period&mdash;[See Page Image] is
      full of vigour, and is admirably enhanced by its harmonic treatment, and
      the gentle counter-phrase in its peaceful motion brings about a soothing
      conclusion. The twofold repetition is effectively varied, and the close is
      emphasised by a novel and beautiful turn. The whole displays the perfect
      mastery of a musician. "If Mozart did not write this," says Marx,<a
      href="#linknote45-66" name="linknoteref45-66" id="linknoteref45-66"> 66
      </a> "well, then he who wrote it is another Mozart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I have seen nothing in Süssmayr's works which can justify me in ascribing
      to him the conception of this movement; much, on the contrary, to convince
      me that the chief ideas at least are Mozart's, and that Süssmayr can
      hardly have had a more important share in this movement than in the
      earlier ones. His whole statement loses, no doubt, its full credibility if
      a well-grounded doubt can be thrown on any one point; but I should not
      like to assert with confidence that in the Sanctus and Benedictus Süssmayr
      must have availed himself of sketches by Mozart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repetition of the first movement at the conclusion of the Mass was not
      unusual at the time. Hasse in his Requiem intones the Lux æterna to the
      same chorale as the Te decet, and then repeats the Requiem; Zelenka does
      the same; Jomelli repeats the Requiem, but adds a fresh conclusion to it.
      Contemplating that portion of the Requiem which Mozart completed, or which
      he left in such a state that to the initiated it is easy to distinguish
      his handiwork, <span class="side">GENERAL REVIEW OF THE WORK.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p391.png">[391]</a></span> we have no
      hesitation in placing this work on the pinnacle of that artistic
      perfection to which the great works of Mozart's later years had attained.<a
      href="#linknote45-67" name="linknoteref45-67" id="linknoteref45-67"> 67
      </a> We see revealed the depth of feeling, the nobility of beauty, the
      mastery of form, the complete spiritual and mental absorption in the task
      before him which have combined to produce this marvellous creation. A
      comparison of the Requiem with other similar compositions, both by Mozart
      himself and his contemporaries, serves to emphasise the vast superiority
      of the former;<a href="#linknote45-68" name="linknoteref45-68"
      id="linknoteref45-68"> 68 </a> for Mozart even here does not absolutely
      reject the forms hallowed by long tradition; he shows his individual
      genius all the more strongly by keeping within them. Still less does he
      run counter to the views which the Requiem, by virtue of its position in
      the Catholic ritual, is meant to express, by any endeavour of his own to
      go further or to introduce something peculiar to himself; that full,
      unfettered devotion which is the indispensable condition of genuine
      artistic production is never disturbed, but human emotion, religious
      belief, and artistic conception go hand in hand in fullest harmony. On
      this unity rests the significance of the Requiem, for on this ground alone
      could Mozart's individuality arrive at full expression, and&mdash;working
      freely and boldly, yet never without consciousness of the limits within
      which it moved&mdash;produce the masterpiece which reveals at every point
      the innermost spirit of its author. In this sense we may indorse his own
      expression, that he wrote the Requiem for himself; it is the truest and
      most genuine <span class="side">THE REQUIEM.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a

      The Requiem met with immediate recognition and approval. "If Mozart had
      written nothing except his violin quintets and his Requiem," Haydn used to
      say, "they would have rendered his name immortal."<a href="#linknote45-70"
      name="linknoteref45-70" id="linknoteref45-70"> 70 </a> It was more
      especially received with enthusiasm in North Germany, where church music,
      unmindful of J. S. Bach, had degenerated into all the triviality and
      insipidity which a slavish adherence to form could produce. It was with
      delight and astonishment that men recognised the union of classical
      severity of form with depth of poetic feeling&mdash;an oasis in the desert
      to those who had long wandered in a waste of sand. The old organist,
      Kittel, at Erfurt, a pupil of Sebastian Bach, received one day the organ
      part of a Requiem which he did not know; the further he proceeded in it,
      the more entranced he became, and on inquiring the composer's name, and
      hearing that it was Mozart, he could scarcely believe his ears, having
      been accustomed to regard Mozart only as the composer of popular operas
      which he knew nothing about. He procured the operas however, and was
      unprejudiced enough to recognise and admire in them the composer of the
      Requiem. So I was told by my music-master, Apel, Kittel's pupil.

    </p>
    <p>
      MOZART'S early and unexpected death, removing him from the eyes of the
      world at the moment when he might seem to have attained the height of his
      artistic greatness, had the effect of silencing the detractions and the
      envy of the few who were blinded by jealousy to his merits, and of
      exalting his works in the minds of those who felt his loss to be an
      irreparable one. Public feeling took the form of sympathy for his bereaved
      family, who were left in pressing need; and they found generous support,
      not in Vienna and Prague alone, but in many other places to which the
      widow made professional visits. When she was in Berlin, in 1796, Frederick
      William II. allowed her the use of the opera-house and the royal musicians
      for a benefit concert, at which she <span class="side">AT THE GRAVE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p394.png">[394]</a></span>
      appeared as a vocalist (February 28). The King, as was stated in the
      programme (Niemetschek, p. 63), "took great pleasure in thus proving to
      the widow how highly he esteemed the talent of her late husband, and how
      much he regretted the unfortunate circumstances which had prevented his
      reaping the due reward of his labours." But such efforts as these could
      not assure her a livelihood for any length of time; nor would the
      manuscripts left by Mozart realise, as matters then stood, anything like a
      sum sufficient for her future needs. His compositions might be spread
      abroad, either in MS. or in print, without her consent or authorisation.
      Indeed, when reference was made to her, she considered it as a favour,<a
      href="#linknote46-1" name="linknoteref46-1" id="linknoteref46-1"> 1 </a>
      and was well pleased when, in 1799, André purchased from her all the
      manuscripts in her possession for a sum of one thousand ducats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of Mozart's manuscripts had been lost before his death, others have
      been made over to other people by André himself, and the remainder are
      included in the "Thematic Catalogue of Mozart's Original Manuscripts in
      the Possession of Hofrath André of Offenbach" (Offenbach, 1841).
      Unhappily, no public library has been able to obtain this most important
      collection, and its dispersion, owing to testamentary dispositions, must
      be a source of regret to all musicians.
    </p>

      Mozart's widow found a means of secure and untroubled existence in her
      second marriage. Georg Nic. Nissen (b. 1765) made her acquaintance, in
      1797, at Vienna, where he was attached to the diplomatic service of
      Denmark, and rendered her great service in the arrangement of her affairs,
      as the numerous letters written by him in her name sufficiently show. He
      appears to have been a tiresome, but an upright and honourable man, and to
      have acted well towards Constanze and her children from the time of their
      marriage in 1809. After resigning his state service, in 1820, he lived
      with her in Salzburg, where also Mozart's sister resided (App. I.). He
      died in 1826, and was followed by his widow on <span class="side">COMMEMORATIONS.</span>

      Karl, the elder of Mozart's two surviving sons, began life as a merchant,
      then tried music,<a href="#linknote46-3" name="linknoteref46-3"
      id="linknoteref46-3"> 3 </a> and finally embraced an official career. He
      was a good pianist, and conducted musical performances, first at the house
      of Colonel Casella, afterwards at his own;<a href="#linknote46-4"
      name="linknoteref46-4" id="linknoteref46-4"> 4 </a> he died in a
      subordinate official post at Milan in 1859. The younger son, Wolfgang,
      became a musician. He first appeared in public in 1805,<a
      href="#linknote46-5" name="linknoteref46-5" id="linknoteref46-5"> 5 </a>
      made repeated professional tours, and after 1814 lived as musical
      director, first at Lemberg, afterwards in Vienna; he died at Carlsbad in
      1844. He was esteemed both as a pianist and composer, but the greatness of
      his name prevented his attaining to more.<a href="#linknote46-6"

      Appreciation and honour had not been wanting to Mozart in his lifetime,
      but they had been far from unalloyed; after his death they were showered
      in fullest measure on his memory.<a href="#linknote46-7"
      name="linknoteref46-7" id="linknoteref46-7"> 7 </a> His loss was
      commemorated in many places by the performance of his own works or of
      specially composed funeral cantatas,<a href="#linknote46-8"
      name="linknoteref46-8" id="linknoteref46-8"> 8 </a> and the anniversaries
      of his birth and of his death are still kept, both in private musical
      circles<a href="#linknote46-9" name="linknoteref46-9" id="linknoteref46-9">
      9 </a> and publicly, by concerts. The hundredth anniversary of his birth,
      which in 1856 caused all Germany to ring with Mozart's name and Mozart's
      music, united every voice into a chorus of praise and honour, and gave a
      new impulse to the study of his works.<a href="#linknote46-10"

      Mozart's personal appearance has become so familiar by means of well-known
      portraits that he may in this respect <span class="side">AT THE GRAVE.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p396.png">[396]</a></span> be
      compared to Frederick the Great or Luther; his music and his countenance
      have alike become common property (App. III.).

      In the year 1799 the Duchess Amalie of Weimar placed a memorial of Mozart
      in the park of Siefurt; it is in terra cotta: a lyre on a pedestal, and
      leaning on it a tragic and a comic mask.<a href="#linknote46-11"
      name="linknoteref46-11" id="linknoteref46-11"> 11 </a> Bridi (Vol. II., p.
      359), in the "Temple to Harmony" which he erected in his garden, has given
      to Mozart the first place among the seven musicians there represented, and
      has placed a monument dedicated to him in a melancholy grotto, with the
      inscription, "Herrscher der Seele durch melodische Denkkraft."<a

      together with a muse playing a lyre and a Cupid with a flute; the other
      side has a portrait of Mozart. A medallion by Bàrend has also a portrait
      in front, the reverse representing Orpheus and a captive lion, with the
      inscription, "Auditus saxis intellectusque ferarum sensibus." The design
      for a medallion by Böhm, which was never struck, was shown to me by my
      friend Karajan. It consists of a refined and intellectual representation
      of Mozart's profile.

      In 1835 the idea took shape of erecting a statue to Mozart in Salzburg. An
      appeal for subscriptions was made in September, 1836,<a
      href="#linknote46-13" name="linknoteref46-13" id="linknoteref46-13"> 13
      </a> and the cast of the statue was completed on May 22, 1841. The
      ceremony of unveiling the figure took place on the Michaelsplatz,
      September 4, 1842.<a href="#linknote46-14" name="linknoteref46-14"
      id="linknoteref46-14"> 14 </a> Unhappily it cannot be said that
      Schwanthaler has succeeded in investing the accepted idea of Mozart as an
      artist and a man with any ideal force and dignity. He is represented
      clothed in the traditional toga, standing with his head turned sidewards
      and upwards, and in his hand a scroll with the inscription, "Tuba mirum."
      In bas-relief on the pedestal are allegorical representations of church,
      concert, and dramatic music, and an eagle flying heavenwards with <span

      erecting a monument to Mozart in the churchyard of St. Mark's. It was
      designed by Hans Gasser, and solemnly unveiled December 5, 1859. A
      mourning muse reposes on a granite pillar, holding in her right hand the
      score of the Requiem, and resting her left, with a laurel wreath, on a
      pile of Mozart's works. On the pedestal are Mozart's portrait and the

      Mozart's name has been more worthily honoured by the foundation of various
      institutions. The Salzburg Mozarteum, founded in 1842, not only preserves
      the most important family documents and interesting relics which were in
      the possession of Mozart's sons; it has the further aim of fostering and
      advancing music, and more especially church music, in Mozart's native
      town.<a href="#linknote46-17" name="linknoteref46-17" id="linknoteref46-17">

      But after all that may be accomplished in honour of Mozart by the most
      enthusiastic of his admirers, his true and imperishable fame rests upon
      his works. A history of modern music will be concerned to show how his
      influence has worked upon his successors, displaying itself sometimes in
      conscious or slavish imitation, sometimes in the freer impulse it has
      given to closely allied natures; and it may truly be said that of all the
      composers who have lived and worked since Mozart there is not one who has
      not felt his inspiration, not one who has not learnt from him, not one who
      at some time or another has not encroached upon his domain. Like all great
      and original geniuses, he belongs to two ages which it was his mission to
      bring together; while quickening and transforming all that his own age can
      offer him as the <span class="side">AT THE GRAVE.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p398.png">[398]</a></span> inheritance
      of the past, he leaves to posterity the offspring of his individual mind
      to serve as a germ for new and more perfect life.

      It would be presumptuous to attempt to summarise in a few phrases the
      result of a life of ceaseless mental activity, and of strongly marked
      individuality. In view of this difficulty many biographers take refuge in
      a comparison of the subject of their work with other great men, and thus
      emphasise the points of resemblance or divergence which exist in their
      natures. No such parallel appears to me more justifiable than one between
      Mozart and Raphael.<a href="#linknote46-20" name="linknoteref46-20"
      id="linknoteref46-20"> 20 </a> The majestic beauty which appears to absorb
      all the other conditions of art production, and to blend them into purest
      harmony, is so overpoweringly present in the works of both masters that
      there is no need to enforce the comparison by dwelling on the many points
      of resemblance in their career both as men and artists, and in their moral
      and intellectual natures. Such a comparison, however, is not profitable
      unless it can be shown how and under what conditions this beauty, so
      varied in its manifestations, so similar in its effects, is produced.<a
      href="#linknote46-21" name="linknoteref46-21" id="linknoteref46-21"> 21
      </a> Although it will readily be acknowledged that Mozart is closely
      related to Shakespeare<a href="#linknote46-22" name="linknoteref46-22"
      id="linknoteref46-22"> 22 </a> in fertility, force, and reality of
      dramatic invention and in breadth of humour, and to Goethe<a
      href="#linknote46-23" name="linknoteref46-23" id="linknoteref46-23"> 23
      </a> in simplicity and naturalness of human sentiment and in plastic
      clearness of idea, yet here again we are confronted with the
      distinguishing qualities of great artists in different provinces of art,
      and Mozart's individuality in his own art is as far as ever from
      explanation. The frequently attempted parallels with great <span
      class="side">CONCLUSION.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p399.png">[399]</a></span> musicians, with Haydn<a
      href="#linknote46-24" name="linknoteref46-24" id="linknoteref46-24"> 24
      </a> or Beethoven,<a href="#linknote46-25" name="linknoteref46-25"
      id="linknoteref46-25"> 25 </a> bring out still more clearly the
      characteristics which distinguish him from all others; and it is to be
      feared that the more ingeniously these comparisons are carried out in
      detail the more the images are distorted and the judgment biassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With whatever feelings, and from whatever point of view, we regard Mozart,
      we are invariably met by the genuine purity of an artist's nature, with
      its irrepressible impulses, its inexhaustible power of production, its
      overflowing love; it is a nature which rejoices in nothing but in the
      manifestation of beauty which is inspired by the spirit of truth; it
      infuses all that it approaches with the breath of its own life, and, while
      conscientious in serious work, it never ceases to rejoice in the freedom
      of genius. All human emotions took a musical form for him, and were by him
      embodied in music; his quick mind grasped at once all that could fittingly
      be expressed in music, and made it his own according to the laws of his
      art. This universality, which is rightly prized as Mozart's distinguishing
      quality, is not confined to the external phenomena which he has
      successfully portrayed in every region of his art&mdash;in vocal and
      instrumental, in chamber and orchestral, in sacred and secular music. His
      fertility and many-sidedness, even from this outward point of view, can
      scarcely indeed be too highly extolled; but there is something higher to
      be sought in Mozart: that which makes music to him not a conquered
      territory but a native home, that which renders every form of musical
      expression the necessary outcome of his inner experience, that by means of
      which he touches every one of his conceptions with the torch of genius
      whose undying flame is visible to all who approach his works with the eyes
      <span class="side">AT THE GRAVE.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p400.png">[400]</a></span> of their imagination unbound.
      His universality has its limits only in the limits of human nature, and
      consequently of his own individual nature. It cannot be considered apart
      from the harmony of his artistic nature, which never allowed his will and
      his power, his intentions and his resources, to come into conflict with
      each other; the centre of his being was the point from which his
      compositions proceeded as by natural necessity. All that his mind
      perceived, or that his spirit felt, every experience of his inner life,
      was turned by him into music; from his inner life proceeded those works of
      imperishable truth and beauty, clothed in the forms and obedient to the
      laws of his art, just as the works of the Divine Spirit are manifested in
      the forms and the laws of nature and history.<a href="#linknote46-26"
      name="linknoteref46-26" id="linknoteref46-26"> 26 </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      And, while our gaze is lifted in reverence and admiration to the great
      musician, it may rest with equal sympathy and love upon the pure-hearted
      man. We can trace in his career, lying clear and open before us, the
      dispensation which led him to the goal of his desires; and, hard as he was
      pressed by life's needs and sorrows, the highest joy which is granted to
      mortals, the joy of successful attainment, was his in fullest measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he was one of us!" his countrymen may exclaim with just pride.<a
      href="#linknote46-27" name="linknoteref46-27" id="linknoteref46-27"> 27
      </a> For, wherever the highest and best names of every art and every age
      are called for, there, among the first, will be the name of Wolfgang Amade
      Mozart.

      APPENDIX I. MARIANNE MOZART.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span class="side">MARIANNE MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p401.png">[401]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      OLFGANG MOZART'S sister, Maria Anna Walburga Ignatia, known to her family
      and friends as Nannerl, was born July 30, 1751, and was thus five years
      older than her brother. She early showed a decided talent for music, and
      made extraordinary progress under her father's tuition. She made her
      appearance as a clavier-player during the early professional tours of the
      Mozart family in 1762, 1763-1766, and 1767, competing successfully with
      the first performers of the day, and overshadowed only by the
      accomplishments of her younger brother. Her father writes (London, June 8,
      1764): "It suffices to say that my little lass at twelve years old is one
      of the most accomplished players in Europe"; and independent accounts
      which have come down to us coincide in this expression of opinion. During
      their stay at the Hague in October, 1765, she was seized with a serious
      illness and brought to the brink of the grave; her recovery, which had
      been despaired of by her parents, was hailed by them with delight. In
      November, 1767, she and Wolfgang were both struck down by smallpox at
      Olmütz; this also she happily recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not accompany her father and brother in their subsequent journeys
      to Italy, but remained at home with her mother. Nevertheless she continued
      her studies as a clavier-player, and made good her claim to be considered
      a virtuoso; as such she was recognised by Burney's informant in 1772
      (Burney, Reise, III., p. 262). She owed much, as she was the first to
      acknowledge, to the example and instruction of her brother, who threw
      himself eagerly into her studies whenever he was in Salzburg. Leopold
      writes to his son (January 26, 1778) that the violinist Janitsch and the
      violoncellist Reicha of the Wallerstein Capelle, who were giving a concert
      in Salzburg, "absolutely insisted upon hearing Nannerl play. They let out
      by their great anxiety to hear your compositions that their object was to
      judge from her <i>gusto</i> of your way of playing. She played your
      Mannheim sonata excellently well, with charming expression. They were
      delighted both with her playing and with the composition. They accompanied
      Nannerl in your trio in B flat (254 K.) exceedingly well." He goes on to
      tell Wolfgang of the high opinions formed by these musicians both of his
      compositions and of Nannerl's style of playing; and how she always
      repeated: "I am but the pupil of my brother." Wolfgang used in after
      years, when they were separated, to send her his pianoforte compositions,
      and set great store on her <span class="side">APPENDIX I.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p402.png">[402]</a></span> judgment,
      frequently also giving her his own opinions and criticisms on music and
      musicians&mdash;as, for instance, on Clementi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne made some few attempts at composition; a song which she sent to
      her brother in Rome excited Wolfgang's astonishment at its excellence, and
      she wrote exercises in thorough-bass which were quite free from mistakes,
      and gave him great satisfaction. Her father remarks at a later date
      (February 25, 1778) that she had learnt to play thoroughbass and to
      prelude exceedingly well, feeling that she would have to support herself
      and her mother after his death. Once (July 20, 1779) when Wolfgang sent
      her from Paris a prelude&mdash;"a sort of capriccio to try the piano with"&mdash;as
      a birthday greeting, she jokingly put her father to the test. She received
      it at four o'clock in the afternoon, and at once set to work to practise
      it till she knew it by heart. When her father came in at five she told him
      that she had an idea, and that if he liked she would write it down, and
      thereupon began the prelude. "I rubbed my eyes," says Leopold Mozart, "and
      said, 'Where the deuce did you get that idea?' She laughed and drew the
      letter from her pocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      She early began to give lessons on the clavier, her father writing from
      Milan (December 12, 1772): "Tell Nannerl that I wish her to teach little
      Zezi carefully and patiently; it will be to her own advantage to instruct
      another person thoroughly and with patience; I know what I am saying."
      These lessons afterwards became a source of income which could hardly have
      been dispensed with in the needy circumstances of the Mozart family; they
      enabled her to support herself as long as she lived at home, and thus
      lightened her father's pecuniary anxieties. She was considered even by her
      own family as somewhat parsimonious, and her father was agreeably
      surprised at hearing her exclaim, when told of Wolfgang's difficulties on
      his Parisian journey: "Thank God that it is no worse!" although she well
      knew that her own interests would have to be sacrificed to help her
      brother out of his scrape. But there is in fact every reason to believe
      that her heart was a tender one, and easily touched; she felt the loss of
      her mother very deeply, and had the warmest sympathy for her brother;
      sometimes indeed this took a livelier form than he cared for, and we find
      him once writing with ill-humour (Mannheim, February 19, 1778): "My best
      love to my sister, and pray tell her not to cry over every trifle, or I
      shall take good care never to come back"&mdash;an expression which did not
      fail to call down a reproof from his father. The relation of the brother
      and sister to each other was from childhood of the tenderest and closest
      description. The severe discipline to which they were both subjected, the
      journeys they took together, and above all the concentration of all the
      thoughts and energies of both upon music, increased their natural
      affection, in which there was not a trace of envy or jealousy on either
      side. Wolfgang vented his love of joking and teasing upon his "Schwester
      Canaglie"; and the letters which he wrote to her while on his Italian tour
      give abundant proofs of their unrestrained and innocent intercourse. The
      joking tone of <span class="side">MARIANNE MOZART.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p403.png">[403]</a></span> Wolfgang's
      correspondence with his sister was not entirely dropped even when they had
      passed their childhood, but they also shared the more serious concerns of
      life together in fullest sympathy. We have seen how unendurable life at
      Salzburg became to Wolfgang as he grew up, and his sister's position was
      in no way a more enviable one. When her mother and brother left home for
      their journey to Paris, she remained to keep house for her father, who
      praised her for her attention, economy, and industry, and for her good
      management of the maid-servant, who was both dirty and untruthful. After
      her mother's death she continued her care of the household, which was
      occasionally increased by their receiving boarders. Pianoforte practice,
      generally with her father for some hours in the evening, and lessons to
      various young ladies, filled up her time. She was much liked as a teacher,
      and her pupils were distinguished for precision and accuracy of playing.
      When Wolfgang was at home, the house was full of life, her father was
      cheerful, and she had a companion with whom to share her joys and sorrows;
      but if he was away, the father, who could scarcely live without him, was
      often gloomy and preoccupied, and not even her tender ministrations could
      compensate him for the absence of his son. Marianne had but few
      distractions from her quiet domestic life in the form of gaiety or
      company; she took a lively interest in the persons and concerns of her few
      acquaintances, an interest which was shared by Wolfgang even when he had
      left Salzburg. "Write to me often&mdash;that is, of course, when you have
      nothing better to do," he writes from Vienna (July 4, 1781) "for a bit of
      news is a great treat to me, and you are the veritable Salzburg
      Intelligencer, for you write about everything that ever happens, and
      sometimes, no doubt to please me, you write the same thing twice over."
      Their father had impressed upon them the importance of keeping a regular
      diary, and this Wolfgang did in his earlier years; Marianne continued the
      habit much longer. Fragments of her diary still exist, and among her
      letters to her brother are two which contain very detailed accounts of the
      performances of Schikaneder's theatrical company at Salzburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of 1780, while Wolfgang was at Munich busy with his
      "Idomeneo," Marianne was seized with an illness which for a time
      threatened to turn into consumption; it was long before she completely
      recovered. It appears probable that an attachment which did not turn out
      happily had something to do with this illness. Marianne, who had been a
      pretty and attractive child, became, as the family picture in the
      Mozarteum shows, a handsome woman, to whom suitors would not be wanting.
      Wolfgang's jokes about Herr von Mölk, an unfavoured admirer of Marianne's,
      as well as other mysterious allusions in his letters, prove that the
      brother and sister shared with each other their tenderest feelings. When
      Mozart was finally settled in Vienna, he lost no opportunity of being
      useful to his sister: "Ma très chère soeur," he writes (Vienna, July 4,
      1781)&mdash;"I am very glad that you liked the ribbons, and will inquire
      as to the price of them; at <span class="side">APPENDIX I.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p404.png">[404]</a></span> present I do
      not know it, since Fr. von Auerhammer, who was so kind as to get them for
      me, would accept no payment, but begged me to say all that was nice to you
      from her as a stranger, and to assure you that it gives her very great
      pleasure to be of any service to you; I have already expressed your
      acknowledgments to her for her kindness. Dearest sister! I have already
      told our father that if you would like anything from Vienna, whatever it
      may be, I will get it for you with the utmost pleasure; this I now repeat
      to you, with the addition that I shall be extremely vexed if I hear that
      you have intrusted your commissions to any one else in Vienna." Constanze
      was always ready at a later time to perform the same sort of service for
      her sister-in-law. But Wolfgang's sympathy with his sister was displayed
      in more serious matters. On July 4, 1781, he writes: "And now I should
      like to know how it stands with you and our very good friend? Write and
      tell me about it. Or have I lost your confidence in this affair?" This
      good friend was Franz D'Yppold, captain in the imperial army, who came to
      Salzburg as Governor to the Pages, and was made Councillor of War in 1777.
      He conceived an attachment to Marianne, which she returned, but his
      circumstances did not allow him to marry. Mozart, seeing that his sister's
      health and happiness were at stake, represented to her that there was
      nothing to hope for in Salzburg, and begged her to induce D'Yppold to try
      his fortune in Vienna, where he, Wolfgang, would do his utmost to advance
      his prospects. She would be able to earn far more by giving lessons in
      Vienna than in Salzburg, and there could be no doubt they would soon be
      able to marry; then the father would be obliged to give up his service at
      Salzburg, and join his children in Vienna. Unfortunately these promising
      plans remained unfulfilled; and as there appeared to the lovers no
      prospect of a possible union, the connection between them ceased. D'Yppold
      never ceased to be on friendly terms with L. Mozart, and always testified
      great sympathy and esteem for Marianne herself. He was very fond of her
      little son, who lived with his grandfather; and, during an absence from
      home of L. Mozart, he came to the house every day to see how the child was
      getting on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marianne returned in kind her brother's interest and sympathy in her love
      affairs. To her he poured out his complaints of the hard fate of himself
      and his Constanze, and the latter began a correspondence with her long
      before her father had reconciled himself to the connection. Correspondence
      between the brother and sister naturally flagged somewhat when Wolfgang
      became engrossed in his life and occupation at Vienna. He justifies
      himself against her reproaches (February 13, 1782): "You must not think
      because I do not answer your letters that I do not like to have them. I
      shall always accept the favour of a letter from you, my dear sister, with
      the utmost pleasure; and if my necessary occupations (for my livelihood)
      allow of it, I will most certainly answer it. You do not mean that I never
      answer your letters? You cannot suppose that <span class="side">MARIANNE
      MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p405.png">[405]</a></span>
      I forget, or that I am careless&mdash;therefore they must be real
      hindrances, real impossibilities that come in the way. Bad enough, you
      will say! But, good heavens I do I write any oftener to my father? You
      both know Vienna t How can a man without a penny of income do anything
      here but work day and night to earn a living? My father, when his church
      service is over, and you, when you have given a couple of music lessons,
      can sit down and write letters all day if you choose; but not I....
      Dearest sister, if you could imagine that I should ever forget my best and
      dearest father or yourself, then&mdash;but no! God knows, and that is
      enough for me&mdash;He will punish me if it should ever happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1784 Marianne married Johann Baptist, Baron von Berchthold, of
      Sonnenburg, councillor of Salzburg and steward of St. Gilgen. Wolfgang
      wrote on her marriage (August 18, 1784): "Ma très chère soeur,&mdash;<i>Potz
      Sapperment!</i> it is time that I write to you if my letter is to find you
      still a virgin! In a couple of days it will be all over! My wife and I
      wish you all manner of happiness and good fortune in your new life, and
      are full of regret that we cannot be present at your wedding; but we are
      in hopes of meeting you and your husband next spring at Salzburg, and
      perhaps also at St. Gilgen. We regret nothing now but the solitude in
      which our father will be left. True, you will be near him, and he can
      often walk over to see you, but he is so tied to that confounded Kapelle!
      If I were in my father's place, this is what I should do: I should ask the
      Archbishop in consideration of my long service to set me free&mdash;and I
      should take my pension and go and live quietly with my daughter at St.
      Gilgen; if the Archbishop refused, I should hand in my resignation and
      join my son in Vienna. And to this I wish you would try every means of
      persuading him. I have written the same thing in my letter to him to-day.
      And now I send you a thousand good wishes from Vienna to Salzburg, summed
      up in the hope that you two may live as happily together as we two. Your
      loving brother, W. A. Mozart."
    </p>
    <p>
      A long list of letters from L. Mozart to his daughter testify to his care
      for her welfare. He is indefatigable in his attention to household
      matters, and occasionally receives from her presents of game or fish; he
      also keeps her constantly informed of what is going on in town. He is, as
      may be supposed, always ready with advice or remonstrance, both to his
      daughter and her husband, whom he considers "too absorbed in the spirit of
      economy"; he makes plenty of sarcastic remarks, but is, on the whole,
      under more restraint with them than with Wolfgang. His keen glance and
      shrewd sense never fail him. His son-in-law's hasty application for the
      stewardship of Neumark drew from him serious advice to weigh everything
      well beforehand, and then to be resigned to what should happen. "I write
      all this," he adds (November 20, 1786), "because I can easily imagine how
      many useless and vexatious ideas and remarks will be let fall upon the
      subject; whereas, if it is to be, the course of Providence cannot be
      withstood." Report said that Marianne <span class="side">APPENDIX I.</span>
      <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p406.png">[406]</a></span> had not
      always an easy time of it with her husband; and five stepchildren cannot
      have left her much leisure for repining. L. Mozart describes them as
      naughty, ill brought up, and ignorant; one of the boys, Wolfgang, was
      heard to boast that "he had got the better of his second mamma, and, when
      he was naughty, papa always laid the blame on her and the servants, and
      blew them up."
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, 1785, she came to Salzburg to be confined in her father's house.
      As her health long remained delicate, L. Mozart kept his little grandson,
      bestowing upon it the tenderest care, and informing his daughter of the
      child's well-being in every letter. "I can never look at the child's right
      hand without emotion," he writes (November 11,1785); "the cleverest
      pianist could not place his hand upon the keys more charmingly than he
      holds his little hand; whenever he is not moving his fingers they are all
      in position for playing, and when he is asleep the tiny fingers are bent
      or stretched exactly in the right proportion, as if they were resting on
      the keys; in short, it is the most charming sight in the world. It often
      makes me sad to see it, and I wish he were three years old, so that he
      might begin to play at once." He could not persuade himself to part with
      the child, and although he often abused the father for never coming to see
      it, he declared himself: "I tell you I mean to keep little Leopold as long
      as I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      After their father's death Wolfgang wrote to Marianne (June 16, 1787):
      "Dearest Sister,&mdash;I am not at all surprised at your not writing to me
      yourself the sad and totally unexpected news of our dear father's death; I
      can readily imagine the cause of your silence. May God receive him to
      Himself! Be assured, my darling, that if you are in need of a faithful,
      loving brother, you will find one in me. My dearest sister, if you were
      still unprovided for, there would be no need of all this. I would, as I
      have intended and said over and over again, have left all to you with the
      greatest pleasure; but as it is, one may almost say, useless to you, while
      to me, on the contrary, it would be of the greatest advantage, I think it
      my duty to consider my wife and child."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter affords no clue to the share of his father's inheritance
      claimed by Mozart, and it is not known how the matter was arranged. It was
      doubtless not without some reference to this that a letter written soon
      after by Mozart to his sister (August, 1787) treated of his pecuniary
      position. "In answer to your question as to my service," he says, "the
      Emperor has taken me into the household, and I am formally appointed, but
      have only 800 florins&mdash;this is more, however, than any other member
      of the household. The announcement of my Prague opera 'Don Giovanni'
      (which is to be given again to-day) ran: 'The music is by Herr Mozart,
      Kapellmeister in the actual service of his Imperial Majesty.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know of any later letters. Marianne kept up no correspondence
      with her brother's widow; from a letter to Sonnleithner (July 2, 1819), we
      gather that she had not heard from her sister-in-law since 1801, that she
      knew nothing of the children, and had only heard of her second marriage by
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1801 the Baron von Sonnenburg died, and his widow retired with her
      children to Salzburg, where she lived in comfort, if not in wealth. She
      returned to her old occupation, and gave music lessons&mdash;for money
      certainly, but not from need, since her simple and frugal way of life
      enabled her even to lay by a portion of her income. She was always much
      respected and liked in Salzburg. In 1820 she became blind, a misfortune
      which she bore with equanimity, and even cheerfulness, as the following
      anecdote will show: Receiving a visit from a lady whom she disliked&mdash;people
      who were fond of her paid her frequent visits to afford her amusement in
      her misfortune&mdash;she exclaimed, when at last the visitor had departed,
      "What an infliction to be obliged to converse with that person! I am glad
      that I cannot see her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She died at an advanced age in her native town, October 29, 1829.

    </p>
    <p>
      EVEN cantatas which appeared under Mozart's name (Leipzig: Breitkopf and
      Hartel, and elsewhere) are perhaps, after his operas, the most widely
      known of his works, and upon them in a great measure rests his fame as a
      composer of church music. Of these cantatas, however, only one, the second
      (and that with altered words), was left in its present state by Mozart;
      the others were all put together after his death from separate portions of
      various church compositions, often widely differing in the time, the
      object and the style of their composition, and having undergone arbitrary
      alterations and additions. Nothing but the newly adopted words holds them
      together, and these are generally trivial, often in direct contradiction
      to the spirit of the original words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parody of Goethe's song "Der du Leid und Sehnsucht stillest," which in
      Cantata III. replaces the original "Alma redemptoris," may serve as an
      example. This double injustice done to the composer may be explained as
      arising from the tendency of an age which turned to its own immediate
      convenience any music which came to hand, with little feeling for the work
      of art as a whole and little respect for the right of the author to the
      integrity of his work or for the claims of historical accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is the result of a survey of the cantatas and their
      component parts (Anh., 124-130 K.):&mdash;[See Page Image]

    <p>
      <span class="side">APPENDIX II.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p408.png">[408]</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantata I. consists of the Kyrie (p. i), Panis omnipotent!ae (p. 10),
      Viaticum (p. 15), and Pignus futurz gloriae (p. 16) of the Litany 125 K-
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantata II. is the Litany 109 K.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantata III. is pot together from the Sanctus of the Mass 259 K. (p. 3);
      the Benedictus of the Mass 220 K.; the Gloria of the Mass 259 K. (p. 9);
      the Offertorium 72 K. (p. 15); and the Credo of the Mass 259 K. (p. 25).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantata IV. consists of the Kyrie and Gloria of the Mass 220 K. (p. 3);
      Motetto 277 K. (p. 12); Gratias (p. 19); and Domine (p. 21) of the Mass in
      C minor 427 K. [employed in the "Davidde Penitente" 469 K. as Chorus 4»
      "Si pur sempre," and Duet 5, "Sorgi o Signore **]; Magnificat of the
      Vesper 193 K. (p. 26).
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantata V. is formed of the Kyrie (p. 1), Et incarnatus, to the close of
      the Credo (p. 6), Benedictus (p. 12), Agnus Dei (p. 20), and Gloria (p.
      25) of the Mass 258 K.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantata VI. contains the Dixit of the Vesper 193 K. (p. 1); Laudate
      Dominum (p. 13) and Magnificat (p. 20) of the Vesper 321 K. Cantata VII.
      is put together from the Kyrie (p. 1) and Benedictus (p. 5) of the Mass
      259 K.; an air from "Davidde Penitente" (469 IL, 3) "Lungi le cure
      ingrate" (p. 14); the Agnus Dei (p. 26) and Dona nobis (p. 29) of the Mass
      259 K.; and the Dixit of the Vesper 321 K. (p. 33).
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, it was not surprising that the choruses from "Konig Tham os"
      should have been used as sacred music, or that the "Frei-maurercantaten"
      (429,471 K.) should have been treated in the same way (Vol. II., p. 407).
      Nor was it unusual to find an altered text (church-like in character)
      supplied to sacred compositions. But secular music was also appropriated
      by the Church. The beautiful adagio of the grand serenata for wind
      instruments (361 K.) has been turned into an offertory, "Quis te
      comprehendat" (Anh., 110 K.). The air for Nancy Storace (405 K.),"Ch' io
      mi scordi di te," has been fitted to the words "In te domine speravi," and
      the obbligato piano part transferred to the organ (Anh., 120 K.). The air
      from "Titus" (19),"Deh per questo istante," with the words "O Deus, ego te
      amo" (Anh., 112 K.), and Adamberger's air, "Per pietà non ricercate"
      (420), with the words "Omni die die Mariae" (Anh., hi K.), are both used
      as offertories. V. Novello published the wonderful ensemble from the
      second finale in "Figaro" "Più docile io sono e dico di si," with the
      words "O Jesu mi, miserere nobis!" as a motett with organ accompaniment,
      and has appended the remark: "This motett may be used at Benediction." It
      is to be hoped that there is no truth in the report that Leparello's
      "Notte e giorno faticar" and Don Giovanni's "Fin che dal vino," have been
      travestied as a "Docti sacris" and a "Lauda Sion."

    </p>
    <p>
      Further than this, however, whole Masses have been arranged from Mozart's
      operas; and at the beginning of this century a "Missa di Figaro. Don
      Giovanni" was not unknown to church choirs. One example of the kind may be
      described as evidence of the fact. In the collection of K. Zulehner of
      Mayence there was preserved a "Coronation Mass" in C major, with Mozart's
      name as composer, of which a copy was sent to me by Herr Schott of
      Mayence. All the movements, with the exception of the Credo, are identical
      with whole movements or smaller portions of "Cosî fan Tutte," with
      alterations of key and instrumentation, and here and there the addition or
      omission of a part, as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kyrie is the terzet (10) "Soave sio il vento," transposed into C major
      and turned into a four-part chorus by the addition of a tenor part, and
      with two flutes to fill in the harmonies. Christe eleison is the first
      movement of the duet (4), "Ah guarda sorella," transposed into G major,
      for soprano and tenor, with two oboes and two horns, shortened here and
      there, and the ritomello placed at the end. At the beginning of the
      Gloria, after a few unimportant bars by the adapter, the motif of the
      first chorus of the second finale is made use of (p. 230); then follow for
      the Gratias agimus the first seventy bars of the air (11) "Smanie
      implacabile" as a soprano solo in F major. The Qui tollis consists of
      seven bars not borrowed, but at the Miserere occur four bars from the
      first finale (p. 115), "Ed il polso," and after the repetition of the
      original Qui tollis at the word "suscipe," the first finale (p. 115), "Ah
      se tardo," is continued to the end of the movement. "Quoniam tu solus" to
      the end of the Gloria is the terzet (3) "Una bella serenata," unaltered up
      to the addition of the fourth part in the tutti passages; the closing
      ritornello is omitted. In the Gloria, flutes, oboes, horns, and drums and
      trumpets are employed in the customary alternations. Sanctus and Osanna
      are the andante of the first finale shortened by six bars, transposed into
      C major, and the parts rather differently arranged to suit the words.
      Benedictus is the duet and chorus (21) "Secondate," transposed into F
      major, and accompanied by stringed instruments flutes, and oboes; the
      chorus enters at "Osanna." Agnus Dei begins with eleven original bars,
      then follows "Idol mio" from the second finale, with the part of Despina
      omitted. Dona nobis is the closing ensemble of the opera. I gather from a
      letter addressed to G. Weber that Zulehner was of opinion that Mozart
      wrote the Mass before the opera; that, on the contrary, the Mass was
      pieced together from the opera by some church musician, no external
      evidence is required to prove.

      Mozarteum, lithographed in Nissen, represents him as a boy of seven years
      old, standing near the clavier, clad in the violet gold-laced court dress
      of the Archduke Maximilian, which had been presented to him in 1762 (Vol.
      I., p. 28). His hair is frizzed and powdered, his hat under his arm, his
      sword by his side; his left hand is thrust into his vest; his right on his
      side. The round good-humoured boyish face, with its candid eyes, looks out
      as if from a disguise. During the stay of the Mozart family in Paris in
      1763, an accomplished admirer, L. C. de Carmontelle, painted them in a
      group; the picture was engraved by Delafosse in small folio, with the
      title under:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "LEOPOLD MOZART, Père de MARIANNE MOZART, Virtuose ägée de onze ans, et de
      J. G. WOLFGANG, Compositeur et Maître de Musique ägé de sept ans."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolfgang, finely dressed and frizzed, is sitting at the harpsichord in a
      pillared hall, apparently open to the air, and playing from some open
      music. The little head is evidently a good likeness, and there is a
      charming expression of earnest attention. His father stands close behind
      him, and accompanies on the violin; the sister is standing on the other
      side of the harpsichord, turning towards her brother and singing from some
      music. In the same year a small oil picture, containing many figures, was
      painted; it was formerly in the gallery of the Duke of Rohan-Chabot at
      Schloss-Rurik, and is now in the Museum at Versailles. Mozart is seated at
      the clavier, on which a "basse de viole" is lying, and playing or singing;
      he is accompanied on the guitar by the opera-singer Veliotte. The Prince
      de Beauveau, in a cherry-coloured coat decorated with the blue Grand
      Cross, is seated behind the young musician, glancing absently at a paper
      which he holds in his left hand. The Chevalier de la Laurency, gentilhomme
      to the Prince de Conti, is standing in a black velvet coat behind Mozart's
      chair; the Prince de Conti is talking to M. de Trudaine; Mdlle. Bagaroty
      is standing before a group of ladies, viz.: Madame la Maréchale de
      Mirepoix, Madame de Viervelle, Madame la Maréchale de Luxembourg, and
      Mdlle. de Boufflers, afterwards Duchesse de Lauzun. The Prince d'Henin is
      preparing tea, while listening attentively to Mozart's music. In another
      group are Dupont de Velse, brother to M. d'Argentai; the Countesses

      The last group shows us the Comtesse de Boufflers standing before a
      well-spread table; by her side is the Comte de Chabot (Duc de Rohan) in
      conversation with the Comte de Jarnac. The Maréchal de Beauveau is pouring
      out a glass of wine for Bailli de Chabrillant; Meyrand, the famous
      geometrician, stands sidewards. The picture is full of life and
      expression. All the company are listening in amazement and delight to
      Mozart's bewitching tones. He is in an apple-green silk coat with knee
      breeches, and his feet do not touch the floor. His countenance is fresh,
      his look full of expression, and the little powdered perruque gives him a
      somewhat pedantic look, at which the spectators are evidently amused.

      Wolfgang was painted several times during his Italian tour. At Verona
      Lugiati made a life-size portrait of him in oils, in two sittings, as his
      father writes home. "La dolce sua effigie mi è di conforto ed altresi di
      eccitamento a riprendere qualche fiata la musica," he writes to the mother
      (April 22, 1770). Sonnleithner, who discovered the picture by the aid of
      the Imperial Sectionsrath W. Booking, gives a detailed account of it.
      Mozart is seated playing the clavier, somewhat to the left of the
      spectator, in a carved arm-chair; his youthful and intellectual
      countenance is turned towards the spectator. He wears a red court dress
      embroidered in gold, and has a diamond ring on the little finger of his
      left hand. Upon the clavier, above the keyboard, is written: "Joanni
      Celestini Veneti, MDLXXXIII." Upon the open music-book can be distinctly
      read:&mdash;[See Page Image]

      This piece, therefore, must have possessed some peculiar interest for the
      Veronese. Below, in the centre of the narrow, beautifully carved gold
      frame, there is a white plate with the following inscription:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amadeo Wolfgango Mozarto Salisburgensi puero duodenni
    </p>
    <p>
      In arte musica laudem omnem fidemque prætergresso eoque nomine Gallorum
      Anglorumque regi caro Petrus Lujatus hospiti suavissimo effigiem in
      domestico odeo pingi curavit anno MDCCLXX.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same year the celebrated artist Pompeo Battoni of Rome painted a
      life-size head of Mozart, which came into the possession of Mr. Haydon of
      London; it is now the property of J. Ella, who has placed it in the South
      Kensington Museum, and rendered it familiar in an engraving by H. Adlard.
      The head is turned almost full-face towards the spectator, the right-hand
      holding a roll of music-paper. The animated countenance has an évident
      resemblance to the Verona portrait, but with more of a view to <span
      class="side">PORTRAITS OF MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      href="pgimages/p413.png">[413]</a></span> effect, being in fact what is
      called idealised. After his return from Italy in 1772, a portrait of
      Wolfgang was painted which his sister possessed; it is the one of which
      she wrote to Sonnleithner (July 2, 1819) that he looked yellow and sickly
      in it, having only lately recovered from a severe illness. Before Mozart
      left Salzburg in 1777, a portrait was painted which, according to his
      father (November 27, 1777), was highly successful. Padre Martini, having
      begged for a likeness of Wolfgang for his collection, the father had a
      copy of this one made and sent it to him in the beginning of December,
      1777, "in a black frame, with a handsomely gilt edge." "I delayed
      complying with your request until now," he writes to the Padre (December
      22,1777), "for want of a skilful artist. There is, in fact, none such
      residing in our town; and I have always been in hopes that, as does
      sometimes happen, a clever artist might visit Salzburg&mdash;I therefore
      postponed it from time to time. At last, however, I was forced to
      commission a local artist to undertake the portrait. As a painting it is
      of little worth, but, as regards the likeness,
    </p>
    <p>
      I assure you that it resembles him exactly. I have written his name and
      age behind the picture." In the library of the Liceo Filarmonico at
      Bologna there is an oil picture from Padre Martini's collection, of which
      Dr. Zangemeister sent me a photograph and a minute description. At the top
      of the frame, in white letters, stands:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      CAV. AMADEO WOLFGANGO MOZART ACCAD.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      FILARMON. DI BOLOG. E DI VERONA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the back is written (probably by an Italian, not by L. Mozart):&mdash;Joannes
      Crisostomus Wolfgangus Amadeus Mozart Salisburgensis Teuto, auratæ Militiæ
      Eques
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonnoniensis Veronensisque Accademicus Natus 27 Ianuarü 1756: Ætatis suæ
      21.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait represents a man in a brown coat, with the gold cross on a
      red ribbon round his neck; to the right is a stool, to the left a clavier
      with black under notes and white over notes; on the desk is a piece of
      music. But it is impossible to recognise Wolfgang in the portrait; it is
      that of a man of middle age, stiff in demeanour, and with no resemblance
      to Mozart. It might be meant for his father, who had promised (August 21,
      1778) to send Padre Mardini his own portrait; but this is contradicted by
      the cross of the order. Probably some confusion has taken place in the
      arrangement of the collection. Wolfgang took with him on his journey a
      little medallion as a present to his cousin, among whose remains it was
      pointed out to me. He is in a red coat, his hair simply arranged, and the
      very youthful face with its <span class="side">APPENDIX III.</span> <span
      class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p414.png">[414]</a></span> intelligent
      eyes has an open light-hearted expression. Before Mozart went to Munich in
      1780 the painter Della Croce at Salzburg began a large family group, and
      Wolfgang's portrait was fortunately finished before his departure. This
      large oil-painting, now in the Mozarteum at Salzburg, represents the
      brother and sister seated at the harpsichord playing a duet. Wolfgang is
      in a red coat with a white vest and neckcloth, Marianne in a dark
      rose-coloured dress trimmed with lace, and a red ribbon in her high
      coiffure; the father, in black, with a white vest and neckcloth, is seated
      behind the harpsichord, his left hand holding a violin, his right with the
      bow resting on the harpsichord. On the wall hangs an oval portrait of the
      mother, with a blue neckhandkerchief, and a blue ribbon in her hair.
      Wolfgang's sister considered this portrait very like him; and it does in
      fact give one an impression of individuality. The face is young for his
      age, but not so gay and animated as in earlier pictures; it has rather a
      depressed expression, corresponding very well to his mood at the time.
      After his marriage he had himself painted with Constanze, and sent the two
      miniatures to Salzburg. "I only hope," he writes (April 3, 1783), "that
      you may be pleased with them; they seem to me to be both good, and all who
      have seen them are of the same opinion." Mozart's brother-in-law, the
      actor Lange, who was an enthusiastic artist, began a portrait of him,
      seated at the piano, in a light brown coat and white neckcloth, and strove
      to render the expression of the artist absorbed in his reveries. The
      picture was only finished as far as the bust, and is now in the Mozarteum
      at Salzburg; Carl Mozart considered it very like. Mozart's short stay in
      Dresden in April, 1789, was utilised by Dora Stock, Korner's talented
      sister-in-law, in taking his portrait in crayons with much delicacy and
      animation; it was engraved in Berlin by E. H. Schroder, and published by
      Ed. Mandel. The conception of Mozart's appearance, which afterwards became
      typical, was formed from a small medallion carved in boxwood in relief by
      Posch, and now preserved in the Salzburg Mozarteum. This was engraved in
      octavo by J. G. Mans-feld, 1789 (Viennæ apud Art aria Societ.) with the
      inscription: "Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori." On the lower edge of
      the medallion, among instruments and laurel branches, is a sheet of music
      with "An Chloe" written on it. This engraving is the foundation of most of
      the later ones; it was engraved afresh from the medallion by Thäter
      (Leipzig: Breitkopf und Hartel).
    </p>
    <p>
      The last portrait of Mozart is a bust, life size, painted by Tischbein
      during his stay in Mayence in October, 1790. C. A. André discovered and
      obtained possession of it at Mayence in 1849; it was among the remains of
      the Electoral court violinist Stutzl. Two men who had themselves seen
      Mozart&mdash;Professor Arentz, of Mayence, and the former court organist,
      Schulz, of Mannheim, on being shown the picture, and asked whom it
      represented, recognised their beloved Mozart without a moment's
      hesitation. At the same time this likeness differs <span class="side">PORTRAITS
      OF MOZART.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a href="pgimages/p415.png">[415]</a></span>
      considerably from the others current, and it can scarcely be doubted that
      Tischbein has idealised the features, especially the nose; but the
      expression of the eyes and mouth has a mixture of sensuousness, roguery,
      and gentle melancholy, which testify to the artist's intellectual
      apprehension; while Posch is probably more accurate in outline, but more
      Philistine in conception. It has been engraved by Sichling in the
      "Bildnissen berühmter Deutschen" (Leipzig: Breitkopf und Hàrtel), and
      afterwards diminished for this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      I consider as apocryphal a small medallion in the possession of Karajan,
      representing a slender well-dressed youth, inscribed as "Mozart's
      Portrait;" also a round miniature, belonging to Frz. Henser, of Cologne,
      of a full-grown man in a grey coat, his hand in his vest, which seems to
      me to have no resemblance to Mozart. It is signed "Jac. Dorn, pinx.,
      1780."

      'cantabilität' with a free instrumental play of ideas, and his very wealth
      of fancy and emotional gifts led to a sort of fermentation in the whole

      exercising a very powerful influence over it" (Vorlesungen, p. 157). It

      performed in Berlin, September 14, 1790 (Schneider, Gesch. d. Oper, p.
      59), and praised by the critics as a masterpiece, while the ordinary
      public preferred Martin and Dittersdorf (Chronik von Berlin, VIII., pp.
      1229, 1244. Berl. Mus. Monatsschr., 1792, p. 137). "Figaro" had no greater
      success in Italy than others of Mozart's operas: "Mozart's operas, at the
      hands of the Italian comic singers and the Italian public, have met with
      the fate which would befall a retiring sober man introduced to a company
      of drunkards; the rioters would be sure to treat the sober man as a fool"
      (Berl. Mus. Ztg., 1793, p. 77). Thus, failure was reported from Florence
      (A. M. Z., III., p. 182) and Milan (A. M. Z., XVII., p. 294). "Figaro" has
      lately been on the repertory of the Italian Opera in Paris; since the
      unfortunate experiment in 1792 (p. 77, note), the opera has been given in
      French at the Théätre Lyrique (1858), with the most brilliant success
      (Scudo, Crit. et Litt. Mus., II., p. 458). "Figaro" was first performed in
      London in 1813 (Catalani sang Susanna&mdash;Parke, Mus. Mem., II., p. 82),
      and kept its place as one of the most favourite of operas.]

      discernment of what is historically true. On a lower level still must be
      placed Herib. Rau's "Cultur-historischer Roman" "Mozart" (Frankfort,
      1858), which has little in common either with culture or history; his

      performed fifteen times during this year. Lange's assertion, therefore,
      that it was withdrawn after the third representation rests upon an error.
      But after 1788 it was removed from the stage, and did not reappear until
      November 5, 1792, in a miserable German adaptation by Spiess. According to
      Da Ponte the Emperor exclaimed, after hearing "Don Giovanni": "The opera
      is divine, perhaps even more beautiful than 'Figaro.' but it will try the
      teeth of my Viennese." To which Mozart answered, on hearing the remark,
      "We will give them time to chew it." Joseph went into head-quarters on
      February 28, 1788, and did not return to Vienna till December 5 (Wien.
      Ztg., 1788, No. 18); he can only, therefore, have been present at the last

      attunes the mind to a higher receptivity; it allows of a freer play of

      to improvise variations upon it. This he did, to Mozart's satisfaction.

      "The favour with which the 'Zauberflöte' has been received, and the
      difficulty of writing a piece which could compete with it, have suggested
      to me the idea of finding in itself the subject of a new work, so as to
      meet the preference of the public half way, as it were, and to simplify
      the performance of a new and complicated piece both to the actors and the
      theatrical management. I believe I shall best attain this object by
      writing a second part to the 'Zauberflöte' the characters are all
      familiar, both to the public and to the actors, and it will be possible,
      having the earlier piece before one, to heighten the climax of the
      situations and events without exaggerating them, and to give life and
      interest to the whole piece." He writes to Wranitzky, further, that it
      will please him to be associated with so talented a man, and that he has
      endeavoured to "open a wide field to the composer, and to touch upon every
      department of poetry, from the most elevated emotions to the lightest

      were made the grounds for shameful suspicions of Salieri, who was said to
      have acknowledged on his deathbed having administered poison to Mozart
      (cf. A. M. Z., XXVII., p. 413). Carpani exonerated Salieri in a long
      article (Biblioteca Italiana, 1824), and brought forward medical testimony
      that Mozart's death was caused by inflammation of the brain, besides the
      assertions of Salieri's attendants during his last illness, that he had
      made no mention of any poisoning at all. Neukomm also, relying on his
      intimacy both with the Mozarts and with Salieri, has energetically
      protested against a calumny (Berlin, allg. mus. Ztg., 1824, p. 172) which
      no sane person would entertain. The grounds on which the rumour was
      discredited by Kapellmeister Schwanenberg of Braunschweig, a friend of
      Salieri, are peculiar. When Sievers, then his pupil, read to him from a
      newspaper the report of Mozart's having been the victim of the Italian's
      envy, he answered: "Pazzi! non ha fatto niente per meritar un tal onore"
      (A. M. Z., XXI., p. 120. Sievers, Mozart u. Sussmayr, p. 3). Daumer has
      striven to support the untenable conjecture that Mozart was poisoned by
      the Freemasons (Aus der Mansarde, IV., p. 75). Finally, the report of the
      poisoning furnished the subject of a dreary novel, "Der Musikfeind," by
      Gustav Nicolai (Arabesken für Musikfreunde, I. Leipzig, 1825).]
